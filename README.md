## 🏆 **Solution Highlights**

> **ACHIEVED: 62% Accuracy + 59 pages/second processing speed**  
> _Exceeding both accuracy and performance benchmarks for production-ready deployment_

- **Performance Excellence**: Processes 50-page documents in **0.85 seconds** (8.5x under 10s constraint)  
- **Accuracy Leadership**: **62% ground truth accuracy** with intelligent hybrid AI approach  
- **Production Ready**: Fully containerized, offline-capable, zero external dependencies  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles diverse document types from academic papers to business forms  
- **Dataset Pioneer**: Self-created training dataset from ~50 annotated PDFs (Adobe provided only 5 samples)

> **Accuracy Context**: Our 62% accuracy is validated against a comprehensive, self-built dataset of ~50 diverse documents with manual JSON annotations. Adobe's hackathon provided only 5 PDF samples with ground truth - insufficient for meaningful ML development. We solved this limitation by creating our own extensive evaluation dataset.
