Some of the comments concerned  subaward reporting under the  Transparency Act but were not directly  related to the content of the guidance.  For example, we received comments  that suggested:  • Specific data elements that either  should be included in, or excluded  from, the information that will be  required for each subaward.  • A need for better definitions of  some data elements or clarification of  the information desired in some data  fields.  • Using the same information  technology systems for submission of  data on both: (1) Subawards under  Federal assistance awards subject to the  Transparency Act’s requirements; and  (2) subcontracts that entities receiving  Federal procurement contracts must  submit under the Act.  • Other specific features that it would  be important to include in those  information technology systems.  When we received them in 2008, we  referred comments that do not directly  relate to the policy guidance to the  appropriate Federal agency groups,  including the groups that were working  on the design of systems to which  entities will submit data to fulfill their  reporting responsibilities under the Act.  As stated in the 2008 Federal Register  notice, the data elements and other  aspects of subaward reporting are  separate from the policy guidance. The  General Services Administration has  recently published the information  collections with an opportunity for  public comment that provide the  specific data elements required for  Transparency Act reporting of  subawards and executive compensation  [75 FR 43165].

"I. Background  On June 6, 2008 [73 FR 32417], the  Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) published proposed guidance to  Federal agencies with an award term  needed to implement requirements  related to subaward reporting under the  Federal Funding Accountability and  Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109–  282, as amended by section 6202 of  Public Law 110–252, hereafter referred  to as ‘‘the Transparency Act’’ or ‘‘the  Act’’). The guidance was proposed for  adoption in a new part 33 within title  2 of the Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR).  We are adopting the interim final  guidance in 2 CFR part 170, a different  2 CFR part than part 33 in which we  originally proposed to adopt it in June  2008. The reason is that part 33 now is  within a newly created subchapter in 2  CFR that is for OMB guidance related to  pre-award responsibilities (for more  information on the new 2 CFR  subchapters, see the notice in today’s  Federal Register that adopts 2 CFR part  25). The content of the guidance  following this preamble is better suited  to another new subchapter for guidance  on national policy requirements, a  subchapter that includes part 170.  We received comments from 75  entities in response to the 2008 Federal  Register notice, including: 29 State  agencies and two associations of State  officials; 16 institutions of higher",1,"(221.98931884765625, 370.6705017089844, 389.2049865722656, 741.236328125)",9.0,Melior,4,792.0,612.0,16,113,0.1415929203539823,0.4794541346429413,0.9203539823008849,False,True,0.0,True,False,0.4680183102386166,0.0,73,0,0.0,947,0,0.8505952842953368,False,True,False,5,8,2.5,0.5,8.0,H1,0.5,167.21566772460938,370.5658264160156,0.4512441671749967,8,27.625,221,4.95475113122172,0.6108597285067874,1351,0.7320503330866025,0.04885270170244264,0.013323464100666173,0.18948926720947445,0.3058823529411765,0.9133858267716536,False,False,True,8,0,0.0,2,0.9911504424778761,H1,Paragraph,CPQ3LPSTBRDPAQHGNDKS2SHAB3JLT2MG.pdf
"SUMMARY: OMB is issuing interim final  guidance to agencies to establish  requirements for Federal financial  assistance applicants, recipients, and  subrecipients that are necessary for the  implementation of the Federal Funding  Accountability and Transparency Act of  2006, hereafter referred to as ‘‘the  Transparency Act’’ or ‘‘the Act’’. This  interim final guidance provides  standard wording for an award term that  each agency must include in grant and  cooperative agreement awards it makes  on or after October 1, 2010, to require  recipients to report information about  first-tier subawards and executive  compensation under only those awards.  This implementation of the requirement  for reporting of subawards and  executive compensation under Federal  assistance awards parallels the  implementation for subcontracts and  executive compensation under Federal  procurement contracts, which is in the  Federal Acquisition Regulation.",1,"(45.0, 392.11407470703125, 214.7547149658203, 638.9746704101562)",9.0,Melior,4,792.0,612.0,17,113,0.1504424778761062,0.4794541346429413,0.9203539823008849,False,True,0.0,True,False,0.495093528670494,0.0,1351,0,0.0,175,0,0.39452819890293434,False,True,False,7,5,2.5,0.5,7.0,Title,0.4666666666666667,169.7547149658203,246.860595703125,0.6876541575309477,3,42.333333333333336,127,6.275590551181103,0.6456692913385826,947,0.8120380147835269,0.009503695881731784,0.010559662090813094,0.1583949313621964,0.35172413793103446,0.8611111111111112,False,True,True,0,0,0.0,5,0.9646017699115044,Title,Paragraph,CPQ3LPSTBRDPAQHGNDKS2SHAB3JLT2MG.pdf

"suggested that the costs should be  allocable as direct program costs. A  number of commenters were concerned  that the added burdens of reporting  could discourage some entities,  especially smaller subrecipient entities,  from applying for Federal grants.

Nevertheless, we understand the  administrative changes and effort that  are associated with reporting on  subawards. As section (d)(2)(A) of the  Transparency Act provides, recipients  and subrecipients are allowed ‘‘to  allocate reasonable costs for the  collection and reporting of subaward  data as indirect costs.’’ We will assess  the overall cost impact of the new  requirements on recipients and  subrecipients, as well as their ability to  recover the indirect costs under current  limitations in statute, policy, program  regulations, or practice.  Comment: Nine commenters  suggested that it was premature to  propose the policy guidance. Among  reasons given were that we did not yet  provide details about all data elements  that will be required in each report of  an obligating action, the definitions of  the data elements, and the reporting  format and procedures that will be used.  A few commenters noted that the award  term in the proposed guidance referred  to a Web site at which entities would  submit subaward data but observed that  the site was not ready to receive data  and had no further details on what or  how to report. One commenter asked if  there was an exception process when  there are systems issues to be resolved.  Response: We revised the wording of  the award term to further clarify that the  Web site will be the source of the  detailed information on what to report  (i.e., the specific data elements and their  definitions) and how to report (i.e., the  formats and information technology  system features). That information will  be posted at the Web site before non-  Federal entities are required to report  data on subaward obligations. In  addition, the General Services  Administration’s Paperwork Reduction  Act information collection also provides  the specific data elements required for  Transparency Act reporting.  There is an important distinction to  be made between the policy guidance  contained in this Federal Register  notice and the operational details on  what and how to report. Under the  current statute, non-Federal entities will  be required to report subaward data, a  basic requirement that does not depend  on the specific data elements and",2,"(399.0059814453125, 60.17619323730469, 568.755126953125, 741.1524658203125)",9.0,Melior,4,792.0,612.0,23,113,0.20353982300884957,0.4794541346429413,0.9203539823008849,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.0759800419662938,-0.8994951248168945,96,0,0.0,67,0,2.2797560023814296,False,False,True,6,2,1.5,0.5,6.0,Title,0.6,169.7491455078125,680.9762725830078,0.24927321603135721,14,28.285714285714285,396,5.4393939393939394,0.5202020202020202,2617,0.8024455483377914,0.00038211692777990065,0.013756209400076424,0.176920137562094,0.4134831460674157,0.8536036036036037,False,False,True,10,0,0.0,8,0.9380530973451328,Title,Paragraph,CPQ3LPSTBRDPAQHGNDKS2SHAB3JLT2MG.pdf

"subawards were subject to Transparency  Act reporting requirements) to have  DUNS numbers and register in the CCR.  Since the publication of the June 2008  proposal, OMB proposed a new part 25  to 2 CFR on February 18, 2010 [75 FR  7316]. The proposed part 25 superseded  the DUNS number and CCR elements of  the June 2008 notice and limited the  DUNS number requirement to  applicants, recipients, and first-tier  subrecipients only. The preamble of the  February 2010 Federal Register  document also contained responses to  the public comments on the DUNS and  CCR requirements proposed in June  2008. Part 25 is being finalized in  another document in this section of  today’s Federal Register. Therefore, the  DUNS and CCR requirements will not  be addressed further in this document.  The remainder of this document  addresses the portions of the 2008  proposal related to reporting of  subawards, as well as the additional  reporting on executive compensation  that is required by the subsequent  amendment to the Transparency Act. In  developing the interim final policy  guidance on subaward reporting, we  considered:  • All comments relevant to that  subject in the 2008 proposal;  • The experience gained under the  guidance for, and practical  implementation of, recipient reporting  required by section 1512 of the  American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111–5, hereafter  referred to as ‘‘the Recovery Act’’),  which we consider to be the pilot  program for subaward reporting  envisioned by paragraph (d)(1) of  section 2 of the Transparency Act; and  • New transparency and Open  Government policies put in effect since  the publication of the 2008 proposal,  including the amendment of the  Transparency Act by section 6202 of  Public Law 110–252 to require the  reporting of the names and total  compensation of a recipient’s or  subrecipient’s five most highly  compensated executives.  Because most aspects of this guidance  were proposed in 2008, with  opportunity for comment, and given the  public benefits to be gained by  expediting the implementation of  subaward reporting under the  Transparency Act, we are publishing  this guidance as interim final.  The following section provides  detailed responses to comments that we  received on the portions of the guidance  proposed in 2008 that are relevant to  subaward reporting.

"Comment: Two commenters noted  that the preamble of the 2008 Federal  Register notice missed one data  element—an award title descriptive of  the purpose of the funding action—  when it listed the data elements that the  Transparency Act specifies for Federal  agencies’ awards.  Response: The commenters are correct  that the Act specifies the additional data  element. The inadvertent omission did  not affect the proposed guidance,  however. The data elements were listed  solely as background explanatory  information in the preamble of the 2008  Federal Register notice.  Comment: With respect to that same  list of data elements in the preamble,  one commenter asked whether the  inclusion of the country of the recipient  and its parent entity was a  typographical error.

Comment: Thirty nine commenters  expressed concern that recipients and  subrecipients must allocate additional  resources in order to comply with the  new requirements for subaward  reporting. They cited the need to change  business processes and systems to begin  to collect data that they are not  collecting now and do it electronically.  They also noted the continuing need for  resources to compile and report data  after that initial transition period. Most  of the commenters noted the fiscal  impact of subaward reporting and the  provision in the Transparency Act that  provides for recovering the additional  costs. Some State agencies expressed  concern that the increased  administration costs would deplete  resources available for program  purposes and some suggested that the  new requirement is an unfunded  mandate. Some institutions of higher  education noted that the limitation in  OMB Circular A–21 on recovery of  indirect costs could prevent them from  recovering those costs from their  Federal awards.

"guidance is distinct from that of the  operational details. What requires PRA  clearance, as correctly noted by the  second commenter, are the data  elements and similar details for which  reporting burdens can be estimated. The  General Services Administration has  recently published the information  collections for public comment that  provide the specific data elements  required for Transparency Act reporting  of subawards and executive  compensation [75 FR 43165]. It is not  pertinent to the issuance of the guidance  in this Federal Register notice on the  basic statutory requirement to report.  Comment: With respect to the  requirement to report each action under  a subaward that obligates $25,000 or  more in Federal funding, ten  commenters recommended raising the  $25,000 threshold due to the potential  magnitude of the burdens, especially on  small entities. The commenters  suggested setting the threshold at  $100,000 or more, to be parallel with  their State’s reporting requirement, the  simplified acquisition threshold for  Federal procurement contracts, or the  threshold in OMB Circular A–133 at  which an entity must have a single  audit. One State agency asked if it could  request a waiver to increase that  threshold.  Response: We made no change to the  threshold in the guidance. The $25,000  threshold is set by the Transparency Act  and there is no provision in the statute  that authorizes a waiver to increase the  threshold.  Comment: Four commenters stated  that the new subaward reporting  requirement overlapped with at least  some Federal agencies’ existing  requirements for reporting on  subawards. As an example, one  commenter cited information about  subawards that applications to agencies  either contain or could be amended to  contain. Two non-Federal entities and  one Federal agency were concerned that  the existing and new requirements  could be redundant, thereby  unnecessarily increasing the burdens of  subaward reporting. One Federal agency  stated that it currently obtained  information about all subawards, and  not just those above the $25,000  threshold, and did not want to lose  insight into the subawards below  $25,000 due to the Transparency Act  threshold.

"paragraph (d)(1) of section 2 of the  Transparency Act. Various audits and  reviews have been conducted on  Recovery Act implementation. Some of  the reports from those reviews are  available on the Recovery.gov Web site  under the ‘‘Accountability’’ section and  include information on recipient  challenges with implementing reporting  requirements under the Recovery Act.  In a memorandum dated April 6, 2010  with the subject line ‘‘Open Government  Directive—Federal Spending  Transparency,’’ OMB established an  October 1, 2010 deadline for Federal  agencies to initiate subaward reporting  pursuant to the Transparency Act and  provide a timeline for additional  guidance to assist in meeting the goals  established in the memorandum.  Comment: Three commenters pointed  out that the proposed guidance did not  include a detailed implementation of a  Transparency Act provision that  provides an exemption from the  subaward reporting requirement for an  entity that demonstrates to the Director  of OMB that its gross income, from all  sources, did not exceed $300,000 in the  previous tax year. The Act provides for  the exemption until the Director  determines that the imposition of the  reporting requirement will not place an  undue burden on such entities. The  commenters noted that the guidance did  not disclose how to request a reporting  exemption, what proofs would be  required, and what evaluation factors  OMB would use in granting exemptions.  Response: The award term in  Appendix A to part 170 of the guidance  properly includes that exception to the  subaward reporting requirement.  Section 2(e) of the Transparency Act  allows the Director, OMB, to exempt  any entity that demonstrates its gross  income, from all sources, did not exceed  $300,000 in the entity’s previous tax  year, from reporting the first-tier  subaward information, until the Director  determines that the imposition of the  reporting requirement will not cause  undue burden on the entity. The  Director has exempted entities that fall  under this category at this time.  Comment: Two commenters raised  questions concerning the applicability  of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA).  One stated that the Transparency Act  and guidance did not comply with the  PRA. The other suggested that OMB  could not yet provide the PRA clearance  for the information collection associated  with subaward reporting, because the  data elements and format were not  specified in the guidance proposed on  2008.  Response: As stated in the response to  a previous comment, the nature of the",3,"(222.00299072265625, 60.25712585449219, 392.328125, 741.224365234375)",9.0,Melior,4,792.0,612.0,35,113,0.30973451327433627,0.4794541346429413,0.9203539823008849,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.07608222961425781,0.0,2497,0,0.0,2477,0,2.2323430875634074,False,False,True,4,6,3.5,0.5,6.0,H1,0.42857142857142855,170.32513427734375,680.9672393798828,0.2501223618810927,14,27.428571428571427,384,5.53125,0.4973958333333333,2575,0.7906796116504854,0.012427184466019418,0.013592233009708738,0.17514563106796116,0.38672768878718533,0.7935779816513762,False,False,True,8,0,0.0,9,0.9292035398230089,H1,Paragraph,CPQ3LPSTBRDPAQHGNDKS2SHAB3JLT2MG.pdf
"procedural details. The policy guidance  and the award term it contains are the  means for having agencies formally  communicate that basic statutory  requirement to recipients and  subrecipients. Neither the guidance nor  the award term needs to contain the  operational details about the specific  data elements to be reported or how to  submit the data. Both need to be in  place now so that agencies can use the  award term to provide timely  notification to recipients and  subrecipients about their  responsibilities.  Nonetheless, we fully recognize that  the operational details also are very  important. To ensure adequate  opportunity for public comment, we  have published the data elements and  other details that affect the public.  Further, we have made every effort to  minimize the burden associated with  Transparency Act reporting, through  both pre-population of data and use of  an electronic system that facilitates  streamlined reporting [75 FR 43165–  43166]. With respect to the question  concerning the exception process, the  Transparency Act does not provide for  exceptions due to unresolved systems  issues.  Comment: Twenty two commenters  recommended delaying the January 1,  2009, date on which the Transparency  Act provided that subaward reporting  would begin. They stated that the  implementation timeframe was not  reasonable, especially since the  procedures for compiling and  submitting the data would not be set  until after completion of a pilot that had  not yet begun. Seven of the commenters  also recommended that OMB grant the  18-month extension to the deadline that  the Act allowed for subrecipients under  awards to State, local, and tribal  governments, if the Director of OMB  determined that compliance would  impose an undue burden for those  subrecipients.  Response: A subaward reporting pilot  was conducted in the Fall of 2008 to  assess the burden of subaward reporting  on recipients and subrecipients. The  results of the pilot were mixed and  showed that there were various  unresolved policy and procedural issues  surrounding subaward reporting. In  2009, the Recovery Act was enacted and  required reporting of funds awarded to  prime recipients, subrecipients and  vendors. The Recovery Act reporting  effort, which commenced in October  2009, served as a demonstration of  subaward reporting on a  governmentwide scale which is why we  consider it to be the pilot program for  subaward reporting envisioned by",3,"(44.999996185302734, 60.27482604980469, 214.82997131347656, 741.2600708007812)",9.0,Melior,4,792.0,612.0,36,113,0.3185840707964602,0.4794541346429413,0.9203539823008849,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.07610457834571299,0.0,2575,0,-4.0,36,0,2.1217129529880228,False,False,True,4,3,2.0,0.5,4.0,Title,0.42105263157894735,169.82997512817383,680.9852447509766,0.24938862690083313,15,24.6,369,5.531165311653116,0.5555555555555556,2477,0.796931772305208,0.012515139281388777,0.012515139281388777,0.17601937828017764,0.39800995024875624,0.8877805486284289,False,False,True,0,0,0.0,24,0.7964601769911505,Title,Paragraph,CPQ3LPSTBRDPAQHGNDKS2SHAB3JLT2MG.pdf

"data regarding other Federal awards.’’  The Transparency Act’s definition of  ‘‘federal award’’ includes types of  financial assistance awards that are not  subject to the administrative  requirements in 2 CFR part 215, and  therefore includes them both at the  prime tier between Federal agencies and  recipients and at lower tiers between  recipients and subrecipients. While only  subawards under grants and cooperative  agreements need to be reported at this  time, subawards under all types of  Federal financial assistance subject to  the Transparency Act will need to be  reported at a later date.  Comment: One Federal agency  expressed concern that it would be  difficult to provide an actual dollar  amount associated with a transfer of  title to Federally owned property.  Response: We revised the definition  of ‘‘Federal financial assistance subject  to the Transparency Act’’ in that section  (which now is section 170.320) to  clarify that the guidance does not apply  to transfers of title to Federally owned  property.  Comment: One Federal agency  suggested amending the proposed  guidance to explicitly exclude  Cooperative Research and Development  Agreements (CRDAs) under 15 U.S.C.  3710a from coverage under the  Transparency Act. CRDAs are  instruments authorized for use between  Federal laboratories and non-Federal  entities for technology transfer  purposes. The commenter noted that the  statute permits a Federal laboratory to  receive funds from a non-Federal entity  under a CRDA and expressed concern  that a funds transfer might be perceived  as a subaward to the Federal laboratory.  Response: We agree and made a  change to the definition of ‘‘Federal  financial assistance subject to the  Transparency Act’’ in that section  (which now is section 170.320) of the  guidance. The definition of ‘‘cooperative  research and development agreement’’  in 15 U.S.C. 3710a excludes transactions  under which Federal funds are provided  to non-Federal entities. It also  distinguishes CRDAs, which are not  Federal financial assistance awards,  from cooperative agreements under the  Federal Grant and Cooperative  Agreement Act in 31 U.S.C., chapter 63.  Comment: One commenter noted that  the proposed guidance did not apply to  a Federal agency that receives an award  from another agency and asked whether  it would apply to an award that a  Federal agency receives from a non-  Federal entity.  Response: Yes, the guidance applies.  The non-Federal entity would have to  report the subaward.

"stimulate financing for small and rural  businesses. The commenter  recommended not applying the  guidance to loan guarantees under those  programs until a Federal Register notice  was published, with an opportunity to  comment, that proposed applying  Transparency Act requirements to those  programs specifically.  Response: Although the 2008 Federal  Register notice proposed applicability  of the guidance broadly to all of the  types of financial assistance subject to  the Transparency Act, we revised the  interim final guidance to implement at  this time only the reporting  requirements specifically for first-tier  subawards under grants and cooperative  agreements in light of these public  comments and concerns. We are  deferring to a later date the  implementation of subaward reporting  under other financial assistance subject  to the Act, which includes loans and  loan guarantees, as well as lower-tier  subawards.  We understand the legitimate concern  that additional administrative  requirements can have an impact on  financial assistance applicants and  recipients under any Federal program.  However, to publish a notice that lists  the hundreds of programs individually  would be unnecessary and impractical.  Comment: One Federal agency  suggested we make it clearer that  financial assistance provided through  assessed and voluntary contributions is  subject to the guidance, by explicitly  listing that type of assistance in the  proposed definition of ‘‘Federal  financial assistance subject to the  Transparency Act.’’ The definition in  section 33.325 of the proposed guidance  included them only implicitly, through  the inclusion of a category of ‘‘other  financial assistance transactions that  authorize the non-Federal entities’  expenditure of Federal funds.’’  Response: We agree and made the  change to the guidance (in what now is  section 170.320).  Comment: A Federal agency  recommended that the guidance not  apply to loans, loan guarantees, interest  subsidies, and insurance that recipients  provide as subawards to subrecipients.  The agency stated that the Transparency  Act did not explicitly identify them as  subawards and their inclusion would be  inconsistent with coverage of the  administrative requirements for grants  to and agreements with educational and  other nonprofit organizations that are in  2 CFR part 215 (OMB Circular A–110).

"intent to make a subaward of a specified  amount if its application is successful.  However, the actual subaward recipient  may not be known at that time or, if  known, the amount that a successful  applicant obligates may not be the same  as it originally planned and proposed,  for various reasons (e.g., the Federal  award it receives may be for a lesser  amount than it proposed or it may  rebudget after receiving the award, as  pertinent Federal rules allow it to do  without the Federal agency’s prior  approval).

"commenters asked how the date of  obligation would be defined for a  subaward that allowed reimbursement  of pre-award costs a subrecipient  incurred on or after a ‘‘start date’’ that  was prior to the date on which the  subaward was signed.  Response: With respect to a subaward,  an obligating action is a transaction that  makes available to the subrecipient a  known amount of funding for program  purposes. Examples include a new  subaward, an incremental funding  amendment that increases the total  amount of a subaward, or a quarterly  allotment under a formula grant  program.  We made no change to the guidance,  since ‘‘obligations’’ is a well established  term in OMB’s guidance on  administrative requirements for grants  and agreements (2 CFR part 215 and the  common rule that Federal agencies  adopted to implement OMB Circular A–  102). Under most Federal grants and  cooperative agreements, recipients  regularly report amounts of ‘‘unobligated  balances’’ to Federal agencies on the  standard financial reporting forms.  The date of obligation for a subaward  is the date on which the recipient  authorizes the subrecipient to incur  costs against the known amount it  obligates, and does so in a way that  legally obliges the recipient to provide  funds to cover costs that are incurred in  accordance with the subaward’s terms  and conditions. That date usually is  associated with the signature of a formal  document, either the initial subaward or  an amendment to it. That is distinct  from the ‘‘start date’’ cited in the  example of pre-award costs, since we  assume that the subrecipient incurs  those costs at its own risk, in  anticipation of the subaward, and that  the recipient has no legal obligation—  until it signs the subaward—to provide  award funds to cover those costs.  Comment: Eight commenters  questioned whether the guidance  required reporting of obligations or  disbursements as the award amounts.  One commenter recommended that  recipients and subrecipients report  ‘‘expenditures,’’ the term used in the  Transparency Act. Four State agencies  asked how ‘‘obligations’’ would be  determined in some programs that  adjust the amount a subrecipient  receives at some time after the initial  obligation. One of the agencies cited the  example of the school lunch program,  under which the amount obligated is  not known until after the subrecipient  expends the funds.  Response: The guidance requires  reporting of each obligation, rather than  each disbursement against the amount",5,"(398.98797607421875, 60.18522644042969, 569.502197265625, 741.1614379882812)",9.0,Melior,4,792.0,612.0,47,113,0.415929203539823,0.4794541346429413,0.9203539823008849,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.07599144752579506,-0.8994951248168945,96,0,0.0,522,0,2.180414657048431,False,False,True,8,2,1.5,0.5,8.0,Title,0.6666666666666666,170.51422119140625,680.9762115478516,0.250396736772683,13,29.615384615384617,385,5.394805194805195,0.509090909090909,2529,0.7943851324634242,0.00276789244760775,0.011071569790431,0.17872676947410043,0.39503386004514673,0.8257918552036199,False,False,True,2,0,0.0,4,0.9734513274336283,Title,Paragraph,CPQ3LPSTBRDPAQHGNDKS2SHAB3JLT2MG.pdf

"non-Federal entity would not have to  report lower-tier subawards. To clarify  this, we revised the definition of ‘‘entity’’  in the award term that now is in  Appendix A to part 170.  Comment: One commenter stated that  it acts as a fund manager overseeing  accounts for Federal agencies into  which voluntary payments, court-  ordered settlements, fines, and other  sources of funds are deposited. It noted  that the Federal agency specifies the  entities to whom funds from those  accounts are obligated. The commenter  asked if it is the recipient in that case  and the other entities are the  subrecipients, or if the entities to whom  it awards the funds are the prime  recipients because the Federal agency  makes the funding decisions.  Response: If the funds cited in the  comment are available for obligation or  reobligation for Federal program  purposes, this situation is somewhat  similar to that of a grant under which  the recipient is authorized to: (1) Make  loans for program purposes to  subrecipients; (2) merge the funds  received from those subrecipients’ loan  payments back into the corpus of grant  funding; and (3) use those repaid funds  to make new loans. In both that case and  the case raised by the commenter, the  non-Federal entity that manages Federal  agency funds that are available for  program purposes is the recipient. The  entities that receive the funds that the  recipient obligates or reobligates are  subrecipients.  Comment: One commenter suggested  not applying the reporting requirement  below the first-tier of subawards under  mandatory programs such as block and  formula grants and other types of  assistance to State, local, and tribal  governments.  Response: The Transparency Act does  not authorize a limitation on the  reporting requirement to the first-tier of  subawards. At this time, however, we  are deferring to a later date the  implementation of the reporting  requirement below the first-tier.  Comment: Six commenters asked  whether the requirements in the  guidance applied to prior program  announcements, awards, and  subawards. One of the commenters  pointed out that an applicant who  already had applied in response to a  previously issued announcement might  have decided not to apply if it had been  informed about the Transparency Act  requirements prior to doing so.

"D. Other Comments  Comment: Two commenters raised  questions about the dates in the  proposed paragraph 33.200(a)(2). One  commenter asked what was meant by  the effective date of the part cited in  paragraph (a)(2)(i). The other  commenter recommended changing the  date in paragraph (a)(2)(ii). That  paragraph required a Federal agency to  incorporate Transparency Act  requirements into a program  announcement or other application  instructions if awards would be made  after October 1, 2008, in response to  applications using those instructions.  The commenter recommended changing  the date to December 31, 2008.  Response: The guidance in 2 CFR part  170 is effective today, with its  publication in the Federal Register. We  revised the date in paragraph  170.200(a)(2)(ii) to October 1, 2010.  Comment: Three commenters noted  that some entities may want to take  advantage of the flexibility that the  award term in the proposed guidance  gave a recipient to either: (1) Pass the  responsibility for reporting on lower-tier  subawards to the subrecipients who  made those subawards; or (2) do that  reporting itself, which would require  the recipient to collect the information  from lower-tier subrecipients. One, a  State agency, stated that it maintains a  complete data base that should be  sufficient to meet the Transparency Act  requirements.  Response: We recognize the burdens  associated with subaward reporting and  understand that programs and  organizations differ. However, prime  recipients will not have the option to  delegate reporting of subgrant  information to their subrecipients. We  believe that this may help reduce  reporting burden on subaward  recipients.  Comment: Six commenters asked for  clarification on the meaning of the  phrases ‘‘date of obligation’’ and  ‘‘obligating action’’ used in the award  term in the proposed section 33.220  with respect to subawards.

Comment: Three commenters raised  issues with wording in the award term  in the proposed section 33.220 that  related to the $25,000 reporting  threshold for subawards. Two  commenters asked for clarification on  the meaning of ‘‘life of the subaward,’’ as  that phrase was used, both in the award  term and the associated guidance to  Federal agencies on use of the award  term. Another commenter suggested that  readers might perceive ‘‘$25,000 over  the life of the subaward’’ to be  inconsistent with ‘‘each action that  obligates $25,000 or more in Federal  funding.’’ One of the commenters also  suggested consistent wording to replace  ‘‘a total value of $25,000’’ in one  paragraph and ‘‘in that range’’ in another  paragraph.  Response: With respect to the  comment concerning the apparent  inconsistency between ‘‘a total value of  25,000’’ and ‘‘each action that obligates  $25,000 or more in Federal funding,’’ it  should be noted that the two phrases  refer to related but different  requirements addressing lower-tier  subaward reporting. We have revised  the interim final guidance to show that  only recipient reporting of first-tier  subawards will be required at this time,  and therefore, the comment is no longer  relevant. We have replaced the phrase  ‘‘life of the subaward’’ with alternative  wording that more clearly specifies  when a recipient must include the  Transparency Act reporting requirement  in a subaward it makes to a  subrecipient. For new Federal grants or  cooperative agreements as of October 1,  2010, if the initial award is $25,000 or  more, reporting of subaward  information is required. If the initial  award is below $25,000 but subsequent  award modifications result in a total  award of $25,000 or more, the award is  subject to the reporting requirements, as  of the date the award exceeds $25,000.  If the initial award is $25,000 or more,  but funding is subsequently de-  obligated such that the total award  amount falls below $25,000, the award  continues to be subject to the reporting  requirements of the Transparency Act.  Comment: One commenter asked for  clarification concerning reporting  requirements for incrementally funded  subawards. The commenter gave as an  example a subaward that a recipient  expected to exceed $25,000 over the  duration of the subaward, but for which",6,"(399.0059814453125, 60.21232604980469, 569.3401489257812, 741.1525268554688)",9.0,Melior,4,792.0,612.0,54,113,0.4778761061946903,0.4794541346429413,0.9203539823008849,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.07602566420429885,-0.8994951248168945,96,0,0.0,2575,0,2.2086366301543965,False,False,True,4,3,2.0,0.5,4.0,Title,0.42105263157894735,170.33416748046875,680.9402008056641,0.2501455594469756,12,32.916666666666664,395,5.29873417721519,0.4835443037974684,2554,0.7513703993735317,0.031323414252153486,0.018010963194988253,0.18050117462803444,0.39148936170212767,0.7228144989339019,False,False,True,0,0,0.0,29,0.7522123893805309,Title,Paragraph,CPQ3LPSTBRDPAQHGNDKS2SHAB3JLT2MG.pdf
"the lower-tier transaction is the same as  the purpose of the substantive program  supported by the Federal award at the  prime tier, so that the recipient through  that lower tier transaction is in effect  handing a portion of the substantive  program over to the lower-tier entity for  performance, the lower-tier transaction  is a subaward. The two examples  follow:  • Example 1: Provision of health  services. A Federal program provides  funding to State agencies to deliver a  variety of services for older citizens. If  the State provides funds to a third party  to carry out a type of service (e.g.,  mental health services) that is  authorized under the program and the  State otherwise might deliver itself, the  agreement is a subaward because the  third party is carrying out substantive  programmatic activity that is the  purpose of the Federal award. If a  recipient or subrecipient obtains the  services of a third party to help in  designing public service  announcements or developing  educational materials about the  program—goods or services that the  State or subrecipient needs to carry out  the program that is the purpose of the  award—that would be a procurement  under the award or subaward.  • Example 2: Research. An agency  makes an award to a university to  investigate basic physics to understand  why certain materials have the  properties they do. To do some of the  experiments, the university researchers  need an instrument that does not yet  exist. The university provides funding  under the Federal award to a small firm  to carry out a research and development  project and develop an instrument. The  award to the firm has the purpose of  instrument development, and does not  have the same purpose as the Federal  award. The award to the firm is a  procurement action. If the university  instead made an award to the firm to  perform some of the basic research on  physics of materials that is the  substantive program purpose of the  Federal award, and the recipient  determines it does not have a vendor  relationship with the firm under this  award as described in Sec. __.210 of the  attachment to OMB Circular A–133, the  award to the firm would be a subaward.  Comment: One commenter from a  State agency said that it is unclear  whether Medicaid is considered Federal  financial assistance for the purposes of  the subaward reporting requirement.  Response: There are no program  exemptions under this guidance even  though there are other types of  exemptions which are described in the  guidance.

"obligated. If a recipient obligates a  specific known amount for a subaward,  even if it may be adjusted later, it must  report the obligation when it is made.  For a program like the school lunch  program, however, where the initial  subaward provides the subrecipient  with an open-ended authorization of  unspecified amount, the obligation date  corresponds to the date on which the  amount of the obligation is specified.  Reporting is required by the end of the  month following the month in which  the subaward obligation was made.  Comment: One commenter  recommended revising the requirement  to report each obligating action within  30 days of the date of obligation. The  commenter suggested allowing reporting  quarterly, semiannually, or annually.  Response: We changed the guidance  and award term to require obligations to  be reported no later than the end of the  month following the month of the  obligation. For example, if a subaward  is made on October 2, 2010, the  subaward information must be reported  by no later than November 30, 2010.  Comment: Ten commenters requested  additional clarification about the  difference between a subaward, which  must be reported under the  Transparency Act, and procurement  under an award, which is not subject to  the reporting requirement.  Response: It is worth noting that  recipients for many years have had to  judge whether a transaction under their  Federal award was a subaward or a  procurement action. That is because a  recipient must include different  requirements in a subaward than it does  in a procurement under an award, in  accordance with the administrative  requirements in 2 CFR part 215 (OMB  Circular A 110) or the common rule  implementing OMB Circular A 102.  Also, when the transaction provides  funds to a for-profit entity, the recipient  must properly take into account  whether the transaction would be more  characteristic of a vendor relationship  than a subrecipient under ___.210 of  OMB Circular A–133. The judgments a  recipient must make to decide whether  a lower tier agreement is a subaward or  procurement for Transparency Act  reporting purposes are the same as the  judgments it makes to establish which  terms and conditions to include in the  agreement. Prime recipients should refer  to awarding agency supplemental  guidance, if any, in making such a  determination.  Two examples may help clarify the  distinction, which is based on the  purpose of the transaction between the  recipient or subrecipient and the entity  at the next lower tier.

"the initial obligation was less than  $25,000.  Response: Each action that obligates  $25,000 or more in Federal funds must  be reported.  Comment: Three commenters asked  whether a recipient or subrecipient  would be required to report a downward  adjustment in the amount of a subaward  it had made previously.  Response: We made no change to the  guidance. The award term that now is  in section Appendix A to part 170 of the  guidance refers recipients and  subrecipients to the web site at which  data submission instructions will be  posted. Those instructions will include  the specific data elements and their  definitions that, as discussed in Section  I of this Federal Register notice, have  been established through a separate  process under the Paperwork Reduction  Act [75 FR 43165]. The instructions will  address whether reporting of reductions  in subaward amounts, sometimes called  ‘‘deobligations,’’ are a subcategory of  obligations to be reported.  Comment: One commenter asked  about the requirement to submit  changed information other than  subaward amounts, such as a change in  subrecipient information.  Response: If the information that was  reported was correct at the time it was  reported and changed at a later date,  there would be no need to subsequently  revise the information in previously  submitted reports. The updated  information would be included in  reports of subsequent obligations under  the same subaward, however.  That is distinct from a case in which  a recipient later discovers that  information it reported was erroneous at  the time it was reported. Questions  concerning error corrections in that case  are being considered by the interagency  group developing the data elements and  information technology systems for  subaward reporting. As discussed in the  response to the previous comment, the  process for resolving those issues will  include an opportunity for public input.  Comment: Four commenters asked  how one would report subawards to  recipients with multiple Federal  funding sources. One commenter asked  if the amount of funding from each  program listed in the Catalog of Federal  Domestic Assistance (CFDA) would  need to be reported.

"Concerns around requests for such data have led donors and humanitarian organizations to place more  emphasis on identifying strategies for data responsibility: the safe, ethical and effective management  of data. Data responsibility requires donors and humanitarian organizations to take actions that help  minimize risks while maximizing benefits of data. This is particularly challenging in cases where donors  request sensitive data. For example, the screening of aid recipients, which is often used to justify requests  for personal data, is not only difficult to practically implement, but also highly problematic in terms of  principled aid.2",1,"(53.43670654296875, 639.7958984375, 535.1995849609375, 732.866943359375)",11.0,SourceSansPro-Regular,4,841.8900146484375,595.2760009765625,11,59,0.1864406779661017,0.49062649178834494,0.9491525423728814,False,True,0.0,True,False,0.7599518788741907,0.0,648,0,-3.5,309,0,1.5641261650592446,False,False,True,3,2,1.0,0.5,3.0,Title,0.46153846153846156,481.76287841796875,93.071044921875,5.176291711588352,4,23.25,93,5.924731182795699,0.7634408602150538,649,0.8320493066255779,0.0015408320493066256,0.015408320493066256,0.1510015408320493,0.3333333333333333,0.9108910891089109,False,False,True,0,0,0.0,21,0.6610169491525424,H2,Paragraph,08036c5a50a93da84c5c45ba468c58159d75281e.pdf

"Survey for the Violence Against Women Act STOP Grant Program  To help the Executive Office of Public Safety (EOPS) and the Violence Against   Women Act (VAWA) Advisory Committee develop their Three Year Strategic   Plan for the Massachusetts Violence Against Women Act STOP (Services,   Training, Officers, Prosecutors) Grant Program, the EOPS is administering a   survey to members of the criminal justice, court, local/state government, and   victim advocate/victim services communities. The survey seeks respondents'   views on the criminal justice system’s response to crimes of sexual assault,   domestic violence, and stalking in Massachusetts, in a number of areas   including: the needs of victims of crimes against women, VAWA program   purpose areas, and underserved populations. The EOPS is particularly interested   in the professional opinions of front-line staff. The survey takes approximately   15-20 minutes to complete.

"Survey for the Violence Against Women Act STOP Grant Program  To help the Executive Office of Public Safety (EOPS) and the Violence Against   Women Act (VAWA) Advisory Committee develop their Three Year Strategic   Plan for the Massachusetts Violence Against Women Act STOP (Services,   Training, Officers, Prosecutors) Grant Program, the EOPS is administering a   survey to members of the criminal justice, court, local/state government, and   victim advocate/victim services communities. The survey seeks respondents'   views on the criminal justice system’s response to crimes of sexual assault,   domestic violence, and stalking in Massachusetts, in a number of areas   including: the needs of victims of crimes against women, VAWA program   purpose areas, and underserved populations. The EOPS is particularly interested   in the professional opinions of front-line staff. The survey takes approximately   15-20 minutes to complete.

"Surgery  Cosmetic surgery is covered only when prior approved for medical  necessity. Examples of medical necessity include prompt repair of  accidental injuries or improvement of the functioning of a  malformed body member.  Elective surgery is covered when medically necessary.  Multiple surgeries are governed by the following rules:  When multiple or bilateral surgical procedures that add significant  time or complexity are performed at the same operative session,   Medicaid pays for the procedure with the highest allowed amount  and half of the allowed amount for each subsequent procedure.  This also applies to laser surgical procedures. Additional  payments will not be made for procedures considered to be  mutually exclusive or incidental. When multiple and/or bilateral  procedures are billed in conjunction with one another that meet  the definition of bundled, subset, CPT’s “Format of Terminology”,  and/or comprehensive/component (bundled) codes, then, the  procedure with the highest allowed amount will be paid while the  lesser procedure will not be considered for payment as the  procedure is considered an integral part of the covered service..  Any dressing/compression wrap performed in conjunction with  wound debridement is considered part of the debridement  services and is not separately covered/billable.  Certain procedures are commonly carried out as integral parts of  a total service and as such do not warrant a separate charge.  When incidental procedures (e.g., excision of a previous scar or  puncture of an ovarian cyst) are performed during the same  operative session, Medicaid reimburses for the major procedure  only.  Laparotomy is covered when it is the only surgical procedure  performed during the operative session or when performed with an  unrelated or incidental surgical procedure. Surgeons performing  laparoscopic procedures on recipients where a laparoscopic  procedure code (PC) has not been established should bill the  most descriptive PC with modifier 22 (unusual procedural  services) until the new PC is established.  CPT defined Add-on codes are considered for coverage when  billed with the appropriate primary procedure code.  Effective January 1, 2005, code 69990 (operating microscope)  may be paid separately only when submitted with the following  CPT codes: 61304-61546, 61550-61711, 62010-62100, 63081- 63308, 63704-63710, 64831, 64834-64836, 64840-64858, 64861- 64870, 64885-64898, 64905-64907.  Certain relatively small surgical procedure codes formally  designated in the CPT with an (*) may be billed in addition to an  office visit.  Additionally, these codes do not carry the global  surgical package concept of inclusion of post-operative care within  62 days of the surgery.  In the 2004 CPT guidelines the (*)  designation has been removed.  For reference, these codes are  listed the Procedure Codes section in Chapter 28 of the Billing  Manual.  It is necessary to append the appropriate anatomical modifiers to  surgical codes to differentiate between multiple surgeries and  sites.  Appropriate use of CPT and HCPCs modifiers is required to  differentiate between sites and procedures.

"Modifier 59 (Distinct Procedural Service)    According to the CPT book, modifier 59 is described as being necessary to  describe a distinct procedural service.  This modifier should only be used to  show a distinct procedural service when a comprehensive/component  coding pair is billed.  Modifier 59 should not be billed to represent that  multiple services of the same procedure code were performed.    A comprehensive/coding pair occurs when one code is considered a  component procedure and the other code is considered a comprehensive  procedure.  These code pairs are frequently referred to as bundled codes  thus meaning the component code is usually considered an integral part of  the comprehensive code.  Therefore, in most instances the most  comprehensive code only should be billed and the component code should  be denied as rebundled or mutually exclusive.    Modifier 59 should only be used in conjunction with a  comprehensive/coding pair procedure when appropriately unbundling the  code pair.  This modifier 59 should not be billed with the comprehensive  code.  The component code can be unbundled, or allowed separately, in  certain situations.  If the two services are performed at two different times  of day or the services are performed in two different anatomical sites, then  modifier 59 can be submitted with the component procedure code.    In order to communicate the special circumstances of the  component/comprehensive code pair unbundling, diagnoses codes and  anatomical modifiers must be utilized as appropriate on the claim form.  In  some cases, it may be necessary to attach a copy of the Operative Report  to further explain the reason for the unbundling of code pairs.    Modifier 59 should never be used in any other circumstances and is  subject to post payment review.

"Modifier 76 (Repeat Procedure)    Prior to January 1, 2004, providers were advised to file multiple services  with modifiers Y2-Y9 and Z2-Z3 to avoid services being denied as  duplicates.  Since these modifiers have been eliminated, we are revising  instructions for filing multiple services that are performed on the same  day.  . The appropriate use of CPT and HCPCS codes is required when  filing claims.  In addition, diagnosis codes and modifiers should assist with  accurately describing services billed.  It is necessary to append the  appropriate anatomical modifiers to procedure codes to differentiate  between multiple sites.  If a claim drops for manual review, the  appropriate use of diagnosis codes and modifiers may assist claim  reviewers in determining the intent of billing without having to request  documentation.  As always, providers can continue to file modifiers RT  and LT when two of the same procedure is performed and one is on the  right side and one is on the left side of the body.  However, if more than  one service is performed on the right or left side, services could be denied  as duplicates if more than one RT or LT modifier is filed on the same  procedure code.  Modifier 76 is defined by the CPT as “Repeat Procedure  by Same Physician”.  Therefore, we are providing the following  instructions to educate providers on how to submit those services.    1) If multiple services are performed, anatomical modifiers can be filed in  addition to modifier 76 on the second line item.  Anatomical modifiers are:   LT, RT, E1-E4, F1-F9, FA, T1-T9, and TA.    Date of Service Place  Procedure  Number of Services  2/4/03-2/4/03  11  73580-RT  1  2/4/03-2/4/03  11  73580-RT76  1    2) If multiple services are performed, anatomical modifiers can be used  without modifier 76.    Date of Service Place  Procedure  Number of Services  2/4/04-2/4/03  11  28820-T8  1  2/4/03-2/4/03  11  28820-TA  1    Multiple services (excluding most surgeries) can also be filed with multiple  units of service.  Modifier 76 is defined as “repeat procedure by same  physician”. The Agency requires claims filed with multiple units of service be  submitted as shown below.     3)  The first line must be submitted with only one unit of service and the  second line with modifier 76 can show the additional number of services that  were performed that day.

"Although efforts are being made to include scenarios and risk projections in humanitarian planning, they largely remain static representations of humanitarian crises at a given moment in time.

"- The Centre should coordinate initial pilots to better understand the potential impact of complex systems modeling techniques in the sector. One promising use case relates to infectious diseases modeling. The development of a Cholera Response Simulator (i.e, a model that would make it possible to simulate and evaluate the effectiveness of different possible cholera response strategies) has been identified as a suitable problem space for a pilot and an opportunity to concretely understand the potential impact of these techniques in the sector. More detailed information on this pilot and preliminary data exploration is available in this repository. - The Centre should develop partnerships with actors from technical research environments and the development sector, where complex systems modeling is more widely in use. - The Centre should create medium-term (6-12 months) research fellowships with academic institutions for students with relevant technical training in systems modeling or sponsor applied doctoral fellowships which would involve sustained collaborations with the Centre on systems modeling projects. - The Centre should coordinate events and develop educational resources tailored to humanitarians to increase uptake of these techniques within the sector. - To help bridge the technical gaps that constitute the main barrier to the adoption of predictive modeling techniques in the sector, the Centre should leverage its annual Data Fellows Programme to implement projects at the intersection of predictive analytics, data literacy, and data visualization. - The Centre should continue its work in closing data gaps and consider how to improve and communicate model accuracy through collaboration between modelers and actors in the field.",4,"(90.0, 174.18359375, 522.2381591796875, 521.036865234375)",11.0,ArialMT,0,842.0,596.0,27,131,0.20610687022900764,-0.10854329464508607,0.9083969465648855,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.20686887618764846,0.0,33,0,5.0,28,1,4.899285592817975,False,False,True,2,2,0.5,0.0,2.0,Title,0.4444444444444444,432.2381591796875,346.853271484375,1.2461700514742267,9,28.666666666666668,258,5.841085271317829,0.5697674418604651,1764,0.8373015873015873,0.0017006802721088435,0.008503401360544218,0.14569160997732428,0.35507246376811596,0.8327272727272728,False,True,False,4,0,0.0,38,0.7175572519083969,H3,Paragraph,f2558b421c2bbdec48e576c09dbc08ddc9f1c4a5.pdf

"- Data availability: A core aspect to consider is whether sufficient data are available to support validation and estimation of a model. Data availability (especially historical data) is often a challenge in countries with humanitarian operations. The lack of data can jeopardize the possibility to build reliable predictive tools2’3. Nevertheless, developing the conceptual component of a model may bring value by fostering trust and synergy between stakeholders, even when quantitative model estimation is not possible. Imperfect proxies or imputed data may also be sufficient in contexts when the focus is not on maximizing the accuracy of pointwise prediction of a certain variable at each time point (e.g., daily numbers of cases in an epidemic), but on projecting holistic scenarios and trends (e.g., when and whether the number of cases is expected to rise significantly). - Synergy with domain experts and actors in the field: Receiving an explicit endorsement and establishing strong partnerships with domain experts and actors in the field is another key condition for model development to be viable. Although this is the case for many predictive modeling efforts, it is especially important for complex systems modeling. In order to identify direct and indirect drivers of humanitarian needs, formulate hypotheses on how these drivers interact, and best tailor the model to its intended applications, modelers need to rely on knowledge provided by domain experts, decision makers and actors close to operations.",8,"(90.0, 203.27587890625, 521.0537719726562, 477.3984375)",11.0,ArialMT,0,842.0,596.0,54,131,0.4122137404580153,-0.10854329464508607,0.9083969465648855,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.24142028373663896,0.0,156,0,0.0,159,0,4.092933340090981,False,False,True,0,2,0.5,0.0,2.0,H1,0.8,431.05377197265625,274.12255859375,1.5724855852213115,8,29.0,232,5.564655172413793,0.6508620689655172,1522,0.8252299605781866,0.001314060446780552,0.01576872536136662,0.15177398160315375,0.3423076923076923,0.9305019305019305,False,True,True,6,0,0.0,46,0.6564885496183206,H3,Paragraph,f2558b421c2bbdec48e576c09dbc08ddc9f1c4a5.pdf

"Network/graph models: Components of the systems are represented as nodes in a network, and their relations (i.e., whether and how each node interacts with each other) are defined by edges connecting each node (which may include loops, i.e., edges that connect nodes with themselves). Complex networks are a specific class of networks which display special topological features. Small-world networks, for example, are networks where nodes tend to be grouped in tight clusters, but a few long-range connections between nodes make clusters communicate with each other. This is an example of a class of complex networks that is often found in real-world phenomena. In human social networks, for example, small-world properties motivate hypotheses postulating that all people are on average a few social connections away from each other (e.g., the six degrees of separation hypothesis). In addition to the complexity of the network structure itself, these models are also able to capture the evolution of dynamic processes in connected complex networks (e.g., an epidemic spreading in a society).",10,"(77.25, 391.251953125, 516.0308837890625, 547.88671875)",10.0,ArialMT,0,842.0,596.0,65,131,0.4961832061068702,-0.5825156812619624,0.1297709923664122,False,False,1.0,False,False,0.46466977805819476,0.0,409,0,0.0,1041,0,2.6568266420524087,False,False,True,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Title,0.0,438.7808837890625,156.634765625,2.8012994563387656,6,27.833333333333332,167,5.538922155688622,0.6646706586826348,1091,0.8111824014665444,0.0,0.02474793767186068,0.152153987167736,0.3865979381443299,0.8963730569948186,False,True,True,8,0,0.0,106,0.1984732824427481,Paragraph,Paragraph,f2558b421c2bbdec48e576c09dbc08ddc9f1c4a5.pdf
"Agent-based modeling: Agent-based models are computational models that make it possible to simulate the behavior of a system based on a description of (i) the type of agents the system consists of and (ii) the rules on how these agents behave and interact. Agent-based models are a microscale modeling technique: the level of description is that of the individual agents, and the macroscale behavior of the system emerges (over the course of a computer simulation) as a function of the cumulative effects of agents’ behaviors and their interactions over time. Agent-based models are often used to predict the dynamics of epidemic diseases as a function of assumptions on how individuals behave (e.g., the average number and duration of social contacts) and on epidemiological parameters (e.g., incubation time, recovery rate). Beyond epidemiology, agent-based modeling is widely used in a number of other fields (e.g., biology, computational social science, and economics). Agent-based models can be validated against real data to understand",10,"(77.25, 567.9384765625, 515.6682739257812, 711.349609375)",10.0,ArialMT,0,842.0,596.0,66,131,0.5038167938931297,-0.5825156812619624,0.1297709923664122,False,False,1.0,False,False,0.6745112548248219,0.0,1091,0,-2.0,313,0,2.4902249369435254,False,False,True,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Title,0.0,438.41827392578125,143.4111328125,3.0570728040966135,5,31.8,159,5.553459119496855,0.5660377358490566,1041,0.8107588856868396,0.0,0.01921229586935639,0.15177713736791545,0.3709677419354839,0.8648648648648649,False,False,True,12,0,0.0,107,0.19083969465648856,Paragraph,Paragraph,f2558b421c2bbdec48e576c09dbc08ddc9f1c4a5.pdf

"System Dynamics: System Dynamics is a technique initially developed for business and industrial applications where systems are represented at the macroscale in terms of stocks (system-level variables), flows (relations between stocks), feedback loops, and time delays. Development of a System Dynamics model involves first formulating hypotheses on which variables are relevant to defining the behavior of the system, and how they interact (i.e., formulating a causal loop diagram and a stock and flow diagram). Equations that quantify the flows are then defined in order to run dynamic simulations of how the system will evolve given a description of its initial state. These simulations can be used to clarify how a variety of mutually interacting factors give rise to specific dynamics in a system, and which component of the system someone could intervene on, in order to change the behavior of the system in the desired direction.",11,"(77.25, 122.7744140625, 516.7523193359375, 252.9619140625)",10.0,ArialMT,0,842.0,596.0,69,131,0.5267175572519084,-0.5825156812619624,0.1297709923664122,False,False,1.0,False,False,0.14581284330463182,0.0,164,0,1.0,740,0,2.1370293221126935,False,False,True,2,1,0.0,0.0,2.0,Title,0.6666666666666666,439.5023193359375,130.1875,3.3759179593734996,4,36.5,146,5.410958904109589,0.6575342465753424,935,0.8224598930481284,0.0,0.014973262032085561,0.15508021390374332,0.38414634146341464,0.901840490797546,False,True,True,6,0,0.0,51,0.6183206106870229,H3,Paragraph,f2558b421c2bbdec48e576c09dbc08ddc9f1c4a5.pdf
