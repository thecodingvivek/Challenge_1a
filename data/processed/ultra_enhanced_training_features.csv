Some of the comments concerned subaward reporting under the Transparency Act but were not directly related to the content of the guidance. For example, we received comments that suggested: • Specific data elements that either should be included in, or excluded from, the information that will be required for each subaward. • A need for better definitions of some data elements or clarification of the information desired in some data fields. • Using the same information technology systems for submission of data on both: (1) Subawards under Federal assistance awards subject to the Transparency Act’s requirements; and (2) subcontracts that entities receiving Federal procurement contracts must submit under the Act. • Other specific features that it would be important to include in those information technology systems. When we received them in 2008, we referred comments that do not directly relate to the policy guidance to the appropriate Federal agency groups, including the groups that were working on the design of systems to which entities will submit data to fulfill their reporting responsibilities under the Act. As stated in the 2008 Federal Register notice, the data elements and other aspects of subaward reporting are separate from the policy guidance. The General Services Administration has recently published the information collections with an opportunity for public comment that provide the specific data elements required for Transparency Act reporting of subawards and executive compensation [75 FR 43165]. The Federal acquisition councils have simultaneously published for public comment their proposed information collection for subcontract reporting pursuant to the Transparency Act. As it was proposed in 2008, the new part 33 would have required direct recipients of Federal agency awards and, with some exceptions, subrecipients at all lower tiers (if their",Paragraph,0.0,62.0,9.0,9.0,1,0,5.0,0.043859649122807015,8.0,27.0,9.0,564.0,320.0,2155.0,5.7375,122.23429870605469,398.9923095703125,169.83917236328125,618.9391021728516,1,0,1.0660184049419648,0,2.0,0.016241299303944315,0.01160092807424594,0.018097447795823667,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,1,0,0.578125,0.6810810810810811,0.046755193199208976,0.0

"I. Background On June 6, 2008 [73 FR 32417], the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published proposed guidance to Federal agencies with an award term needed to implement requirements related to subaward reporting under the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109– 282, as amended by section 6202 of Public Law 110–252, hereafter referred to as ‘‘ the Transparency Act ’’ or ‘‘ the Act ’’ ). The guidance was proposed for adoption in a new part 33 within title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). We are adopting the interim final guidance in 2 CFR part 170, a different 2 CFR part than part 33 in which we originally proposed to adopt it in June 2008. The reason is that part 33 now is within a newly created subchapter in 2 CFR that is for OMB guidance related to pre-award responsibilities (for more information on the new 2 CFR subchapters, see the notice in today’s Federal Register that adopts 2 CFR part 25). The content of the guidance following this preamble is better suited to another new subchapter for guidance on national policy requirements, a subchapter that includes part 170. We received comments from 75 entities in response to the 2008 Federal Register notice, including: 29 State agencies and two associations of State officials; 16 institutions of higher",H1,0.0,37.0,9.0,9.0,1,0,17.0,0.14912280701754385,8.71990982691447,73.0,8.977592786153158,929.0,226.0,1320.0,4.845132743362832,370.6705017089844,221.98931884765625,167.21566772460938,370.5658264160156,0,0,1.0660184049419648,0,2.0,0.04621212121212121,0.05,0.030303030303030304,1,0,0.0,1.0,0,0,1,1,0.5707964601769911,0.7286821705426356,0.15896765687731051,0.8508771929824561
"SUMMARY : OMB is issuing interim final guidance to agencies to establish requirements for Federal financial assistance applicants, recipients, and subrecipients that are necessary for the implementation of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, hereafter referred to as ‘‘ the Transparency Act ’’ or ‘‘ the Act ’’ . This interim final guidance provides standard wording for an award term that each agency must include in grant and cooperative agreement awards it makes on or after October 1, 2010, to require recipients to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under only those awards. This implementation of the requirement for reporting of subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards parallels the implementation for subcontracts and executive compensation under Federal procurement contracts, which is in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.",Paragraph,0.0,25.0,8.977592786153158,9.0,1,0,18.0,0.15789473684210525,9.0,1320.0,8.887963930765789,172.0,133.0,929.0,5.992481203007519,392.11407470703125,45.0,169.7547149658203,246.860595703125,0,1,1.06336434912372,0,2.0,0.02906350914962325,0.00968783638320775,0.02045209903121636,1,0,0.0,1.0,0,0,0,1,0.5639097744360902,0.7466666666666667,0.1678996340721663,0.8421052631578947

"suggested that the costs should be allocable as direct program costs. A number of commenters were concerned that the added burdens of reporting could discourage some entities, especially smaller subrecipient entities, from applying for Federal grants. Response: This guidance requires only prime grant recipients to report to the Federal Government on subawards and executive compensation. Nevertheless, we understand the administrative changes and effort that are associated with reporting on subawards. As section (d)(2)(A) of the Transparency Act provides, recipients and subrecipients are allowed ‘‘ to allocate reasonable costs for the collection and reporting of subaward data as indirect costs. ’’ We will assess the overall cost impact of the new requirements on recipients and subrecipients, as well as their ability to recover the indirect costs under current limitations in statute, policy, program regulations, or practice. Comment: Nine commenters suggested that it was premature to propose the policy guidance. Among reasons given were that we did not yet provide details about all data elements that will be required in each report of an obligating action, the definitions of the data elements, and the reporting format and procedures that will be used. A few commenters noted that the award term in the proposed guidance referred to a Web site at which entities would submit subaward data but observed that the site was not ready to receive data and had no further details on what or how to report. One commenter asked if there was an exception process when there are systems issues to be resolved. Response: We revised the wording of the award term to further clarify that the Web site will be the source of the detailed information on what to report ( i.e., the specific data elements and their definitions) and how to report ( i.e., the formats and information technology system features). That information will be posted at the Web site before non- Federal entities are required to report data on subaward obligations. In addition, the General Services Administration’s Paperwork Reduction Act information collection also provides the specific data elements required for Transparency Act reporting. There is an important distinction to be made between the policy guidance contained in this Federal Register notice and the operational details on what and how to report. Under the current statute, non-Federal entities will be required to report subaward data, a basic requirement that does not depend on the specific data elements and",H3,1.0,69.0,9.0,9.0,1,0,24.0,0.21052631578947367,10.449747562408447,95.0,9.0,66.0,400.0,2553.0,5.385,60.17619323730469,399.0059814453125,169.7491455078125,680.9762725830078,1,0,1.0660184049419648,0,2.0,0.014884449667058363,0.0003916960438699569,0.020759890325107718,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.5375,0.6883720930232559,0.2244249273562031,0.0

"subawards were subject to Transparency Act reporting requirements) to have DUNS numbers and register in the CCR. Since the publication of the June 2008 proposal, OMB proposed a new part 25 to 2 CFR on February 18, 2010 [75 FR 7316]. The proposed part 25 superseded the DUNS number and CCR elements of the June 2008 notice and limited the DUNS number requirement to applicants, recipients, and first-tier subrecipients only. The preamble of the February 2010 Federal Register document also contained responses to the public comments on the DUNS and CCR requirements proposed in June 2008. Part 25 is being finalized in another document in this section of today’s Federal Register. Therefore, the DUNS and CCR requirements will not be addressed further in this document. The remainder of this document addresses the portions of the 2008 proposal related to reporting of subawards, as well as the additional reporting on executive compensation that is required by the subsequent amendment to the Transparency Act. In developing the interim final policy guidance on subaward reporting, we considered: • All comments relevant to that subject in the 2008 proposal; • The experience gained under the guidance for, and practical implementation of, recipient reporting required by section 1512 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111–5, hereafter referred to as ‘‘ the Recovery Act ’’ ), which we consider to be the pilot program for subaward reporting envisioned by paragraph (d)(1) of section 2 of the Transparency Act; and • New transparency and Open Government policies put in effect since the publication of the 2008 proposal, including the amendment of the Transparency Act by section 6202 of Public Law 110–252 to require the reporting of the names and total compensation of a recipient’s or subrecipient’s five most highly compensated executives. Because most aspects of this guidance were proposed in 2008, with opportunity for comment, and given the public benefits to be gained by expediting the implementation of subaward reporting under the Transparency Act, we are publishing this guidance as interim final. The following section provides detailed responses to comments that we received on the portions of the guidance proposed in 2008 that are relevant to subaward reporting.

"Comment: Two commenters noted that the preamble of the 2008 Federal Register notice missed one data element—an award title descriptive of the purpose of the funding action— when it listed the data elements that the Transparency Act specifies for Federal agencies’ awards. Response: The commenters are correct that the Act specifies the additional data element. The inadvertent omission did not affect the proposed guidance, however. The data elements were listed solely as background explanatory information in the preamble of the 2008 Federal Register notice. Comment: With respect to that same list of data elements in the preamble, one commenter asked whether the inclusion of the country of the recipient and its parent entity was a typographical error. The commenter suggested that the data element likely was meant to be the county, rather than the country.

Comment: Thirty nine commenters expressed concern that recipients and subrecipients must allocate additional resources in order to comply with the new requirements for subaward reporting. They cited the need to change business processes and systems to begin to collect data that they are not collecting now and do it electronically. They also noted the continuing need for resources to compile and report data after that initial transition period. Most of the commenters noted the fiscal impact of subaward reporting and the provision in the Transparency Act that provides for recovering the additional costs. Some State agencies expressed concern that the increased administration costs would deplete resources available for program purposes and some suggested that the new requirement is an unfunded mandate. Some institutions of higher education noted that the limitation in OMB Circular A–21 on recovery of indirect costs could prevent them from recovering those costs from their Federal awards.

"guidance is distinct from that of the operational details. What requires PRA clearance, as correctly noted by the second commenter, are the data elements and similar details for which reporting burdens can be estimated. The General Services Administration has recently published the information collections for public comment that provide the specific data elements required for Transparency Act reporting of subawards and executive compensation [75 FR 43165]. It is not pertinent to the issuance of the guidance in this Federal Register notice on the basic statutory requirement to report. Comment: With respect to the requirement to report each action under a subaward that obligates $25,000 or more in Federal funding, ten commenters recommended raising the $25,000 threshold due to the potential magnitude of the burdens, especially on small entities. The commenters suggested setting the threshold at $100,000 or more, to be parallel with their State’s reporting requirement, the simplified acquisition threshold for Federal procurement contracts, or the threshold in OMB Circular A–133 at which an entity must have a single audit. One State agency asked if it could request a waiver to increase that threshold. Response: We made no change to the threshold in the guidance. The $25,000 threshold is set by the Transparency Act and there is no provision in the statute that authorizes a waiver to increase the threshold. Comment: Four commenters stated that the new subaward reporting requirement overlapped with at least some Federal agencies’ existing requirements for reporting on subawards. As an example, one commenter cited information about subawards that applications to agencies either contain or could be amended to contain. Two non-Federal entities and one Federal agency were concerned that the existing and new requirements could be redundant, thereby unnecessarily increasing the burdens of subaward reporting. One Federal agency stated that it currently obtained information about all subawards, and not just those above the $25,000 threshold, and did not want to lose insight into the subawards below $25,000 due to the Transparency Act threshold. Response: Relatively few Federal agency awarding offices currently obtain the details about each subaward obligation that they would need to do the reporting under the Transparency Act. Many agencies receive individual applications that identify the applicant’s",Paragraph,2.0,69.0,9.0,9.0,1,0,35.0,0.30701754385964913,10.449747562408447,95.0,9.0,2511.0,364.0,2429.0,5.675824175824176,60.22135925292969,399.0059814453125,170.334228515625,680.9762725830078,1,0,1.0660184049419648,0,2.0,0.02058460271716756,0.0168793742280774,0.019761218608480857,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.5796703296703297,0.7014218009478673,0.32728635239446285,0.0
"paragraph (d)(1) of section 2 of the Transparency Act. Various audits and reviews have been conducted on Recovery Act implementation. Some of the reports from those reviews are available on the Recovery.gov Web site under the ‘‘ Accountability ’’ section and include information on recipient challenges with implementing reporting requirements under the Recovery Act. In a memorandum dated April 6, 2010 with the subject line ‘‘ Open Government Directive—Federal Spending Transparency, ’’ OMB established an October 1, 2010 deadline for Federal agencies to initiate subaward reporting pursuant to the Transparency Act and provide a timeline for additional guidance to assist in meeting the goals established in the memorandum. Comment: Three commenters pointed out that the proposed guidance did not include a detailed implementation of a Transparency Act provision that provides an exemption from the subaward reporting requirement for an entity that demonstrates to the Director of OMB that its gross income, from all sources, did not exceed $300,000 in the previous tax year. The Act provides for the exemption until the Director determines that the imposition of the reporting requirement will not place an undue burden on such entities. The commenters noted that the guidance did not disclose how to request a reporting exemption, what proofs would be required, and what evaluation factors OMB would use in granting exemptions. Response: The award term in Appendix A to part 170 of the guidance properly includes that exception to the subaward reporting requirement. Section 2(e) of the Transparency Act allows the Director, OMB, to exempt any entity that demonstrates its gross income, from all sources, did not exceed $300,000 in the entity’s previous tax year, from reporting the first-tier subaward information, until the Director determines that the imposition of the reporting requirement will not cause undue burden on the entity. The Director has exempted entities that fall under this category at this time. Comment: Two commenters raised questions concerning the applicability of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). One stated that the Transparency Act and guidance did not comply with the PRA. The other suggested that OMB could not yet provide the PRA clearance for the information collection associated with subaward reporting, because the data elements and format were not specified in the guidance proposed on 2008. Response: As stated in the response to a previous comment, the nature of the",Paragraph,2.0,69.0,9.0,9.0,0,0,36.0,0.3157894736842105,9.0,2429.0,9.0,2409.0,388.0,2511.0,5.474226804123711,60.25712585449219,222.00299072265625,170.32513427734375,680.9672393798828,1,0,1.0660184049419648,0,0.0,0.03106332138590203,0.012743926722421346,0.022301871764237355,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.5515463917525774,0.6869158878504673,0.3366373910343046,0.0
"procedural details. The policy guidance and the award term it contains are the means for having agencies formally communicate that basic statutory requirement to recipients and subrecipients. Neither the guidance nor the award term needs to contain the operational details about the specific data elements to be reported or how to submit the data. Both need to be in place now so that agencies can use the award term to provide timely notification to recipients and subrecipients about their responsibilities. Nonetheless, we fully recognize that the operational details also are very important. To ensure adequate opportunity for public comment, we have published the data elements and other details that affect the public. Further, we have made every effort to minimize the burden associated with Transparency Act reporting, through both pre-population of data and use of an electronic system that facilitates streamlined reporting [75 FR 43165– 43166]. With respect to the question concerning the exception process, the Transparency Act does not provide for exceptions due to unresolved systems issues. Comment: Twenty two commenters recommended delaying the January 1, 2009, date on which the Transparency Act provided that subaward reporting would begin. They stated that the implementation timeframe was not reasonable, especially since the procedures for compiling and submitting the data would not be set until after completion of a pilot that had not yet begun. Seven of the commenters also recommended that OMB grant the 18-month extension to the deadline that the Act allowed for subrecipients under awards to State, local, and tribal governments, if the Director of OMB determined that compliance would impose an undue burden for those subrecipients. Response: A subaward reporting pilot was conducted in the Fall of 2008 to assess the burden of subaward reporting on recipients and subrecipients. The results of the pilot were mixed and showed that there were various unresolved policy and procedural issues surrounding subaward reporting. In 2009, the Recovery Act was enacted and required reporting of funds awarded to prime recipients, subrecipients and vendors. The Recovery Act reporting effort, which commenced in October 2009, served as a demonstration of subaward reporting on a governmentwide scale which is why we consider it to be the pilot program for subaward reporting envisioned by",Paragraph,2.0,69.0,9.0,9.0,0,0,37.0,0.32456140350877194,9.0,2511.0,5.0,36.0,369.0,2409.0,5.531165311653116,60.27482604980469,44.999996185302734,169.82997512817383,680.9852447509766,1,1,1.0660184049419648,0,0.0,0.016604400166044003,0.012868410128684102,0.014943960149439602,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,1,0.5636856368563685,0.7259615384615384,0.34598842967414645,0.0

"data regarding other Federal awards. ’’ The Transparency Act’s definition of ‘‘ federal award ’’ includes types of financial assistance awards that are not subject to the administrative requirements in 2 CFR part 215, and therefore includes them both at the prime tier between Federal agencies and recipients and at lower tiers between recipients and subrecipients. While only subawards under grants and cooperative agreements need to be reported at this time, subawards under all types of Federal financial assistance subject to the Transparency Act will need to be reported at a later date. Comment: One Federal agency expressed concern that it would be difficult to provide an actual dollar amount associated with a transfer of title to Federally owned property. Response: We revised the definition of ‘‘ Federal financial assistance subject to the Transparency Act ’’ in that section (which now is section 170.320) to clarify that the guidance does not apply to transfers of title to Federally owned property. Comment: One Federal agency suggested amending the proposed guidance to explicitly exclude Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRDAs) under 15 U.S.C. 3710a from coverage under the Transparency Act. CRDAs are instruments authorized for use between Federal laboratories and non-Federal entities for technology transfer purposes. The commenter noted that the statute permits a Federal laboratory to receive funds from a non-Federal entity under a CRDA and expressed concern that a funds transfer might be perceived as a subaward to the Federal laboratory. Response: We agree and made a change to the definition of ‘‘ Federal financial assistance subject to the Transparency Act ’’ in that section (which now is section 170.320) of the guidance. The definition of ‘‘ cooperative research and development agreement ’’ in 15 U.S.C. 3710a excludes transactions under which Federal funds are provided to non-Federal entities. It also distinguishes CRDAs, which are not Federal financial assistance awards, from cooperative agreements under the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act in 31 U.S.C., chapter 63. Comment: One commenter noted that the proposed guidance did not apply to a Federal agency that receives an award from another agency and asked whether it would apply to an award that a Federal agency receives from a non- Federal entity. Response: Yes, the guidance applies. The non-Federal entity would have to report the subaward.

"stimulate financing for small and rural businesses. The commenter recommended not applying the guidance to loan guarantees under those programs until a Federal Register notice was published, with an opportunity to comment, that proposed applying Transparency Act requirements to those programs specifically. Response: Although the 2008 Federal Register notice proposed applicability of the guidance broadly to all of the types of financial assistance subject to the Transparency Act, we revised the interim final guidance to implement at this time only the reporting requirements specifically for first-tier subawards under grants and cooperative agreements in light of these public comments and concerns. We are deferring to a later date the implementation of subaward reporting under other financial assistance subject to the Act, which includes loans and loan guarantees, as well as lower-tier subawards. We understand the legitimate concern that additional administrative requirements can have an impact on financial assistance applicants and recipients under any Federal program. However, to publish a notice that lists the hundreds of programs individually would be unnecessary and impractical. Comment: One Federal agency suggested we make it clearer that financial assistance provided through assessed and voluntary contributions is subject to the guidance, by explicitly listing that type of assistance in the proposed definition of ‘‘ Federal financial assistance subject to the Transparency Act. ’’ The definition in section 33.325 of the proposed guidance included them only implicitly, through the inclusion of a category of ‘‘ other financial assistance transactions that authorize the non-Federal entities’ expenditure of Federal funds. ’’ Response: We agree and made the change to the guidance (in what now is section 170.320). Comment: A Federal agency recommended that the guidance not apply to loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, and insurance that recipients provide as subawards to subrecipients. The agency stated that the Transparency Act did not explicitly identify them as subawards and their inclusion would be inconsistent with coverage of the administrative requirements for grants to and agreements with educational and other nonprofit organizations that are in 2 CFR part 215 (OMB Circular A–110). Response: We did not revise the guidance. The Act requires OMB to ‘‘ ensure that data regarding subawards are disclosed in the same manner as",Paragraph,3.0,69.0,9.0,9.0,1,0,42.0,0.3684210526315789,9.0,2482.0,9.0,1892.0,364.0,2477.0,5.8076923076923075,60.23912048339844,222.00299072265625,169.3350830078125,680.9582672119141,1,0,1.0660184049419648,0,2.0,0.019378280177634235,0.008881711748082357,0.019781994348001614,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.5604395604395604,0.6813725490196079,0.3927436228733554,0.0
"intent to make a subaward of a specified amount if its application is successful. However, the actual subaward recipient may not be known at that time or, if known, the amount that a successful applicant obligates may not be the same as it originally planned and proposed, for various reasons ( e.g., the Federal award it receives may be for a lesser amount than it proposed or it may rebudget after receiving the award, as pertinent Federal rules allow it to do without the Federal agency’s prior approval). Given that what the application describes is only a plan, it cannot serve as a definitive source of information for Transparency Act purposes. At this time, we are not asking for reporting of subaward information below the first-tier. With respect to the relatively few Federal awarding offices that do obtain post-award data on actual subaward obligations, we are directing those agencies to take the necessary steps to ensure that their recipients are not required, due to the combination of agency-specific and Transparency Act reporting requirements, to submit the same or similar data multiple times during a given reporting period. Comment: Five commenters asked about the consequences of a subrecipient’s noncompliance with requirements related to the Transparency Act. Two commenters expressed concern that delivery of essential services could be interrupted if awards could not be made or payments had to be suspended. Response: After a subaward is made, the range of consequences that may result from the subrecipient’s material failure to comply with a requirement related to the Transparency Act should be no different than it is for a material failure to comply with other Federal requirements. The same remedies are available to the recipient and—should the matter of a subrecipient entity’s noncompliance become an issue for the Federal Government—to a Federal agency.",Paragraph,3.0,53.0,9.0,9.0,0,0,43.0,0.37719298245614036,9.0,2477.0,9.0,550.0,300.0,1892.0,5.31,60.27482604980469,44.99999237060547,169.7714614868164,522.9813385009766,1,1,1.0660184049419648,0,0.0,0.013742071881606765,0.0,0.019027484143763214,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.53,0.7610062893081762,0.4020946615131972,0.0

"commenters asked how the date of obligation would be defined for a subaward that allowed reimbursement of pre-award costs a subrecipient incurred on or after a ‘‘ start date ’’ that was prior to the date on which the subaward was signed. Response: With respect to a subaward, an obligating action is a transaction that makes available to the subrecipient a known amount of funding for program purposes. Examples include a new subaward, an incremental funding amendment that increases the total amount of a subaward, or a quarterly allotment under a formula grant program. We made no change to the guidance, since ‘‘ obligations ’’ is a well established term in OMB’s guidance on administrative requirements for grants and agreements (2 CFR part 215 and the common rule that Federal agencies adopted to implement OMB Circular A– 102). Under most Federal grants and cooperative agreements, recipients regularly report amounts of ‘‘ unobligated balances ’’ to Federal agencies on the standard financial reporting forms. The date of obligation for a subaward is the date on which the recipient authorizes the subrecipient to incur costs against the known amount it obligates, and does so in a way that legally obliges the recipient to provide funds to cover costs that are incurred in accordance with the subaward’s terms and conditions. That date usually is associated with the signature of a formal document, either the initial subaward or an amendment to it. That is distinct from the ‘‘ start date ’’ cited in the example of pre-award costs, since we assume that the subrecipient incurs those costs at its own risk, in anticipation of the subaward, and that the recipient has no legal obligation— until it signs the subaward—to provide award funds to cover those costs. Comment: Eight commenters questioned whether the guidance required reporting of obligations or disbursements as the award amounts. One commenter recommended that recipients and subrecipients report ‘‘ expenditures, ’’ the term used in the Transparency Act. Four State agencies asked how ‘‘ obligations ’’ would be determined in some programs that adjust the amount a subrecipient receives at some time after the initial obligation. One of the agencies cited the example of the school lunch program, under which the amount obligated is not known until after the subrecipient expends the funds. Response: The guidance requires reporting of each obligation, rather than each disbursement against the amount",Paragraph,4.0,69.0,9.0,9.0,0,0,48.0,0.42105263157894735,10.449747562408447,95.0,9.0,509.0,397.0,2473.0,5.231738035264484,60.18522644042969,398.98797607421875,170.51422119140625,680.9762115478516,1,0,1.0660184049419648,0,0.0,0.01293974929235746,0.0028305701577031944,0.02466639708855641,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.5314861460957179,0.7014218009478673,0.4488498547124062,0.0

"non-Federal entity would not have to report lower-tier subawards. To clarify this, we revised the definition of ‘‘ entity ’’ in the award term that now is in Appendix A to part 170. Comment: One commenter stated that it acts as a fund manager overseeing accounts for Federal agencies into which voluntary payments, court- ordered settlements, fines, and other sources of funds are deposited. It noted that the Federal agency specifies the entities to whom funds from those accounts are obligated. The commenter asked if it is the recipient in that case and the other entities are the subrecipients, or if the entities to whom it awards the funds are the prime recipients because the Federal agency makes the funding decisions. Response: If the funds cited in the comment are available for obligation or reobligation for Federal program purposes, this situation is somewhat similar to that of a grant under which the recipient is authorized to: (1) Make loans for program purposes to subrecipients; (2) merge the funds received from those subrecipients’ loan payments back into the corpus of grant funding; and (3) use those repaid funds to make new loans. In both that case and the case raised by the commenter, the non-Federal entity that manages Federal agency funds that are available for program purposes is the recipient. The entities that receive the funds that the recipient obligates or reobligates are subrecipients. Comment: One commenter suggested not applying the reporting requirement below the first-tier of subawards under mandatory programs such as block and formula grants and other types of assistance to State, local, and tribal governments. Response: The Transparency Act does not authorize a limitation on the reporting requirement to the first-tier of subawards. At this time, however, we are deferring to a later date the implementation of the reporting requirement below the first-tier. Comment: Six commenters asked whether the requirements in the guidance applied to prior program announcements, awards, and subawards. One of the commenters pointed out that an applicant who already had applied in response to a previously issued announcement might have decided not to apply if it had been informed about the Transparency Act requirements prior to doing so. Others noted they would need to amend previously issued awards if the requirements applied to them.

"D. Other Comments Comment: Two commenters raised questions about the dates in the proposed paragraph 33.200(a)(2). One commenter asked what was meant by the effective date of the part cited in paragraph (a)(2)(i). The other commenter recommended changing the date in paragraph (a)(2)(ii). That paragraph required a Federal agency to incorporate Transparency Act requirements into a program announcement or other application instructions if awards would be made after October 1, 2008, in response to applications using those instructions. The commenter recommended changing the date to December 31, 2008. Response: The guidance in 2 CFR part 170 is effective today, with its publication in the Federal Register . We revised the date in paragraph 170.200(a)(2)(ii) to October 1, 2010. Comment: Three commenters noted that some entities may want to take advantage of the flexibility that the award term in the proposed guidance gave a recipient to either: (1) Pass the responsibility for reporting on lower-tier subawards to the subrecipients who made those subawards; or (2) do that reporting itself, which would require the recipient to collect the information from lower-tier subrecipients. One, a State agency, stated that it maintains a complete data base that should be sufficient to meet the Transparency Act requirements. Response: We recognize the burdens associated with subaward reporting and understand that programs and organizations differ. However, prime recipients will not have the option to delegate reporting of subgrant information to their subrecipients. We believe that this may help reduce reporting burden on subaward recipients. Comment: Six commenters asked for clarification on the meaning of the phrases ‘‘ date of obligation ’’ and ‘‘ obligating action ’’ used in the award term in the proposed section 33.220 with respect to subawards.

"under a grant or cooperative agreement to an entity other than an individual who is a natural person, the subaward is $25,000 or more, and no exemptions apply, the state would need to report the subaward. Comment: Three commenters raised issues with wording in the award term in the proposed section 33.220 that related to the $25,000 reporting threshold for subawards. Two commenters asked for clarification on the meaning of ‘‘ life of the subaward, ’’ as that phrase was used, both in the award term and the associated guidance to Federal agencies on use of the award term. Another commenter suggested that readers might perceive ‘‘ $25,000 over the life of the subaward ’’ to be inconsistent with ‘‘ each action that obligates $25,000 or more in Federal funding. ’’ One of the commenters also suggested consistent wording to replace ‘‘ a total value of $25,000 ’’ in one paragraph and ‘‘ in that range ’’ in another paragraph. Response: With respect to the comment concerning the apparent inconsistency between ‘‘ a total value of 25,000 ’’ and ‘‘ each action that obligates $25,000 or more in Federal funding, ’’ it should be noted that the two phrases refer to related but different requirements addressing lower-tier subaward reporting. We have revised the interim final guidance to show that only recipient reporting of first-tier subawards will be required at this time, and therefore, the comment is no longer relevant. We have replaced the phrase ‘‘ life of the subaward ’’ with alternative wording that more clearly specifies when a recipient must include the Transparency Act reporting requirement in a subaward it makes to a subrecipient. For new Federal grants or cooperative agreements as of October 1, 2010, if the initial award is $25,000 or more, reporting of subaward information is required. If the initial award is below $25,000 but subsequent award modifications result in a total award of $25,000 or more, the award is subject to the reporting requirements, as of the date the award exceeds $25,000. If the initial award is $25,000 or more, but funding is subsequently de- obligated such that the total award amount falls below $25,000, the award continues to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Transparency Act. Comment: One commenter asked for clarification concerning reporting requirements for incrementally funded subawards. The commenter gave as an example a subaward that a recipient expected to exceed $25,000 over the duration of the subaward, but for which",Paragraph,5.0,68.0,9.0,9.0,0,0,55.0,0.4824561403508772,10.449747562408447,95.0,9.0,2509.0,411.0,2503.0,5.092457420924574,60.21232604980469,399.0059814453125,170.33416748046875,680.9402008056641,1,0,1.0660184049419648,0,0.0,0.009588493807431082,0.03196164602477027,0.037554934079105075,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.5206812652068127,0.6355140186915887,0.5143071251912988,0.0
"the lower-tier transaction is the same as the purpose of the substantive program supported by the Federal award at the prime tier, so that the recipient through that lower tier transaction is in effect handing a portion of the substantive program over to the lower-tier entity for performance, the lower-tier transaction is a subaward. The two examples follow: • Example 1: Provision of health services. A Federal program provides funding to State agencies to deliver a variety of services for older citizens. If the State provides funds to a third party to carry out a type of service ( e.g., mental health services) that is authorized under the program and the State otherwise might deliver itself, the agreement is a subaward because the third party is carrying out substantive programmatic activity that is the purpose of the Federal award. If a recipient or subrecipient obtains the services of a third party to help in designing public service announcements or developing educational materials about the program—goods or services that the State or subrecipient needs to carry out the program that is the purpose of the award—that would be a procurement under the award or subaward. • Example 2: Research. An agency makes an award to a university to investigate basic physics to understand why certain materials have the properties they do. To do some of the experiments, the university researchers need an instrument that does not yet exist. The university provides funding under the Federal award to a small firm to carry out a research and development project and develop an instrument. The award to the firm has the purpose of instrument development, and does not have the same purpose as the Federal award. The award to the firm is a procurement action. If the university instead made an award to the firm to perform some of the basic research on physics of materials that is the substantive program purpose of the Federal award, and the recipient determines it does not have a vendor relationship with the firm under this award as described in Sec. __ .210 of the attachment to OMB Circular A–133, the award to the firm would be a subaward. Comment: One commenter from a State agency said that it is unclear whether Medicaid is considered Federal financial assistance for the purposes of the subaward reporting requirement. Response: There are no program exemptions under this guidance even though there are other types of exemptions which are described in the guidance.

"obligated. If a recipient obligates a specific known amount for a subaward, even if it may be adjusted later, it must report the obligation when it is made. For a program like the school lunch program, however, where the initial subaward provides the subrecipient with an open-ended authorization of unspecified amount, the obligation date corresponds to the date on which the amount of the obligation is specified. Reporting is required by the end of the month following the month in which the subaward obligation was made. Comment: One commenter recommended revising the requirement to report each obligating action within 30 days of the date of obligation. The commenter suggested allowing reporting quarterly, semiannually, or annually. Response: We changed the guidance and award term to require obligations to be reported no later than the end of the month following the month of the obligation. For example, if a subaward is made on October 2, 2010, the subaward information must be reported by no later than November 30, 2010. Comment: Ten commenters requested additional clarification about the difference between a subaward, which must be reported under the Transparency Act, and procurement under an award, which is not subject to the reporting requirement. Response: It is worth noting that recipients for many years have had to judge whether a transaction under their Federal award was a subaward or a procurement action. That is because a recipient must include different requirements in a subaward than it does in a procurement under an award, in accordance with the administrative requirements in 2 CFR part 215 (OMB Circular A 110) or the common rule implementing OMB Circular A 102. Also, when the transaction provides funds to a for-profit entity, the recipient must properly take into account whether the transaction would be more characteristic of a vendor relationship than a subrecipient under ___ .210 of OMB Circular A–133. The judgments a recipient must make to decide whether a lower tier agreement is a subaward or procurement for Transparency Act reporting purposes are the same as the judgments it makes to establish which terms and conditions to include in the agreement. Prime recipients should refer to awarding agency supplemental guidance, if any, in making such a determination. Two examples may help clarify the distinction, which is based on the purpose of the transaction between the recipient or subrecipient and the entity at the next lower tier.

"the initial obligation was less than $25,000. Response: Each action that obligates $25,000 or more in Federal funds must be reported. Comment: Three commenters asked whether a recipient or subrecipient would be required to report a downward adjustment in the amount of a subaward it had made previously. Response: We made no change to the guidance. The award term that now is in section Appendix A to part 170 of the guidance refers recipients and subrecipients to the web site at which data submission instructions will be posted. Those instructions will include the specific data elements and their definitions that, as discussed in Section I of this Federal Register notice, have been established through a separate process under the Paperwork Reduction Act [75 FR 43165]. The instructions will address whether reporting of reductions in subaward amounts, sometimes called ‘‘ deobligations, ’’ are a subcategory of obligations to be reported. Comment: One commenter asked about the requirement to submit changed information other than subaward amounts, such as a change in subrecipient information. Response: If the information that was reported was correct at the time it was reported and changed at a later date, there would be no need to subsequently revise the information in previously submitted reports. The updated information would be included in reports of subsequent obligations under the same subaward, however. That is distinct from a case in which a recipient later discovers that information it reported was erroneous at the time it was reported. Questions concerning error corrections in that case are being considered by the interagency group developing the data elements and information technology systems for subaward reporting. As discussed in the response to the previous comment, the process for resolving those issues will include an opportunity for public input. Comment: Four commenters asked how one would report subawards to recipients with multiple Federal funding sources. One commenter asked if the amount of funding from each program listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) would need to be reported. Response: Each action that obligates $25,000 or more in Federal funding would need to be separately reported.

This is not a new phenomenon; the need for accountability and transparency in the use of donor funding is broadly understood and respected. However, in recent years, donors have begun requesting data that can be sensitive. This includes personal data about beneficiaries and various forms of disaggregated data, such as household-level survey results and data about the delivery of assistance disaggregated by demographic and/or group dimensions (e.g. ethnicity, protection group, etc.). 1",Paragraph,0.0,7.0,10.78157143365769,11.0,0,0,10.0,0.1694915254237288,11.0,12.0,10.672357150486537,644.0,97.0,643.0,5.639175257731959,534.2024536132812,53.4535026550293,493.33586502075195,93.071044921875,0,1,1.1027101052901047,0,0.0,0.006220839813374806,0.0015552099533437014,0.029548989113530325,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,1,0.5876288659793815,0.8947368421052632,0.18690001784578045,0.0
"Concerns around requests for such data have led donors and humanitarian organizations to place more emphasis on identifying strategies for data responsibility: the safe, ethical and effective management of data. Data responsibility requires donors and humanitarian organizations to take actions that help minimize risks while maximizing benefits of data. This is particularly challenging in cases where donors request sensitive data. For example, the screening of aid recipients, which is often used to justify requests for personal data, is not only difficult to practically implement, but also highly problematic in terms of principled aid. 2",Paragraph,0.0,7.0,10.672357150486537,11.0,0,0,11.0,0.1864406779661017,10.78157143365769,643.0,6.754549980163574,299.0,94.0,644.0,5.861702127659575,639.7958984375,53.43670654296875,481.76287841796875,93.071044921875,0,1,1.0915399623813553,0,0.0,0.006211180124223602,0.0015527950310559005,0.015527950310559006,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,1,0.6276595744680851,0.847457627118644,0.20350745061347303,0.0

"In addition, sharing seemingly innocuous data such as aggregated survey results can place already vulnerable people and communities at greater risk. What may be initially considered non-personal data 3 can allow for re-identification of individuals, communities and demographic groups. Re-identification occurs when data can be traced back or linked to an individual(s) or group(s) of individuals because it is not adequately anonymized.

"Many donors and humanitarian actors recognize the risks and benefits associated with sharing such sensitive data, but the sector has yet to establish a common understanding of how to balance these risks and benefits effectively. Recent efforts to address this issue have led to more clarity on current practices, as well as on the objectives and constraints of data sharing. In September 2020, the Government of Switzerland, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) Centre for Humanitarian Data (the Centre) organized a virtual Wilton Park dialogue to help build common understanding on this issue. 5",Paragraph,1.0,7.0,10.78157143365769,11.0,0,0,16.0,0.2711864406779661,10.3629166815016,612.0,10.49033334520128,281.0,108.0,692.0,5.416666666666667,135.42433166503906,52.858299255371094,478.03482818603516,93.07107543945312,1,1,1.1027101052901047,0,0.0,0.046242774566473986,0.0072254335260115606,0.01878612716763006,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,1,1,0.6018518518518519,0.8923076923076924,0.29904002855324874,0.0

"March 31, 2003 This Announcement is issued pursuant to § 521(b) of Pub. L. 106-170, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, requiring that the Secretary of the Treasury annually report to the public concerning Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) and the APA Program. The first report covered calendar years 1991 through 1999. Subsequent reports covered calendar years 2000 and 2001. This fourth report describes the experience of the APA Program during calendar year 2002 consistent with the mandate of § 521(b). This document does not provide guidance regarding the application of the arm’s length standard; rather, it reports on the structure and activities of the APA program. Mindy Piatoff Acting Director, Advance Pricing Agreement Program Background Internal Revenue Code (IRC) § 482 provides that the Secretary may distribute, apportion, or allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances between or among two or more commonly controlled businesses if necessary to reflect clearly the income of such businesses. Under the regulations, the standard to be applied in determining the true taxable income of a controlled business is that of a business dealing at arm’s length with an unrelated business. The arm’s length standard also has been adopted by the international community and is incorporated into the transfer pricing guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). OECD, T RANSFER P RICING G UIDELINES FOR M ULTINATIONAL E NTERPRISES AND T AX A DMINISTRATORS (1995). Transfer pricing issues by their nature are highly factual and have traditionally been one of the largest issues identified by the IRS in its audits of multinational corporations. The APA Program is designed to resolve actual or potential transfer pricing disputes in a principled, cooperative manner, as an alternative to the traditional examination process. An APA is a binding contract between the IRS and a taxpayer by which the IRS agrees not to seek a transfer pricing adjustment under IRC § 482 for a covered transaction if the taxpayer files its tax return for a covered year consistent with the agreed transfer pricing method (TPM). In year 2002, the IRS and taxpayers executed 85 APAs and amended 9 APAs. Since 1991, with the issuance of Rev. Proc. 91-22, 1991-1 C.B. 526, the IRS has offered taxpayers through the APA Program the opportunity to reach an agreement in advance of filing a",H2,0.0,31.0,11.986175132786624,13.800000190734863,1,0,1.0,0.006172839506172839,16.605714137970455,67.0,12.0,1.0,390.0,2450.0,5.2846153846153845,72.1620101928711,72.0000228881836,469.7355728149414,640.2297744750977,1,1,1.013894465733687,0,2.0,0.0746938775510204,0.030612244897959183,0.025306122448979593,0,0,2.0,1.0,0,1,0,0,0.5871794871794872,0.7685589519650655,0.006258607813170908,2.9814814814814814

"tax return on the appropriate TPM to be applied to related party transactions. In 1996, the IRS issued internal procedures for processing APA requests. Chief Counsel Directives Manual (CCDM), ¶¶ 42.10.10 – 42.10.16 (November 15, 1996). Also in 1996, the IRS updated Rev. Proc. 91-22 with the release of Rev. Proc. 96-53, 1996-2 C.B. 375. The APA Program continues to operate under the provisions of Rev. Proc. 96-53, which provides taxpayers with instructions of how to apply for an APA, and what to expect in the processing of the case. In addition, in 1998, the IRS published Notice 98-65, 1998-2 C.B. 803, which set forth streamlined APA procedures for Small Business Taxpayers (SBTs). That Notice also expanded the availability of the lowest APA user fee in an effort to attract taxpayers who may not have the resources to do the sophisticated economic studies normally required in APA submissions. Advance Pricing Agreements An APA generally combines an agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS on an appropriate TPM for the transactions at issue (Covered Transactions) with an agreement between the U.S. and one or more foreign tax authorities (under the authority of the mutual agreement process of our income tax treaties) that the TPM is correct. With such a “bilateral” APA, the taxpayer ordinarily is assured that the income associated with the Covered Transactions will not be subject to double taxation by the IRS and the foreign tax authority. It is the policy of the United States, as reflected in § 7 of Rev. Proc. 96-53 to encourage taxpayers that enter the APA program to seek bilateral or multilateral APAs when competent authority procedures are available with respect to the foreign country or countries involved. However, the IRS may execute an APA with a taxpayer without reaching a competent authority agreement (a “unilateral” APA). A unilateral APA is an agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS establishing an approved TPM for U.S. tax purposes. A unilateral APA binds the taxpayer and the IRS, but obviously does not prevent foreign tax administrations from taking different positions on the appropriate TPM for a transaction. As stated in Rev. Proc. 96-53, should a transaction covered by a unilateral APA be subject to double taxation as the result of an adjustment by a foreign tax administration, the taxpayer may seek relief by requesting that the U.S. Competent Authority consider initiating a mutual agreement proceeding, provided there is an applicable income tax treaty in force with the other country. When a unilateral APA involves taxpayers operating in a country that is a treaty partner, information relevant to the APA (including a copy of the APA and APA annual reports) may be provided to the treaty partner under normal rules and principles governing the exchange of information under income tax treaties. The APA Program APAs are negotiated with the taxpayer by an IRS team headed by an APA team leader. As of December 31, 2002, the APA program had 17 team leaders. The team leader is responsible for organizing the IRS APA team. The IRS APA team arranges meetings with the taxpayer, secures whatever information is necessary from the taxpayer to analyze the taxpayer’s related party transactions and the available facts under the arm’s length standard of IRC § 482 and the regulations thereunder (Treas. Reg.), and negotiates with the taxpayer.",H2,1.0,40.0,12.090000009536743,13.800000190734863,1,0,3.0,0.018518518518518517,12.0,1.0,12.0,1.0,554.0,3393.0,5.126353790613718,71.50801086425781,72.0,469.800048828125,639.0836639404297,1,1,1.0226768726963953,0,2.0,0.05776598880047156,0.024167403477748307,0.030356616563513114,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,1,1,1,0.5884476534296029,0.6288343558282209,0.018938460605488802,0.0

"The APA team generally includes an economist, an international examiner, LMSB field counsel, and, in a bilateral case, a U.S. Competent Authority analyst who leads the discussions with the treaty partner. The economist may be from the APA Program or the IRS field organization. As of December 31, 2002, the APA Program had 7 economists. The APA team may also include an LMSB International Technical Advisor, other LMSB exam personnel, and an Appeals officer. The APA Process The APA process is voluntary. Taxpayers submit an application for an APA, together with a user fee as set forth in Rev. Proc. 96-53. The APA process can be broken into five phases: (1) application; (2) due diligence; (3) analysis; (4) discussion and agreement; and (5) drafting, review, and execution. (1) Application In many APA cases, the taxpayer’s application is preceded by a pre-file conference with the APA staff in which the taxpayer can solicit the informal views of the APA Program. Pre-file conferences can occur on an anonymous basis, although a taxpayer must disclose its identity when it applies for an APA. Taxpayers must file the appropriate user fee on or before the due date of the tax return for the first taxable year that the taxpayer proposes to be covered by the APA. Many taxpayers file a user fee first and then follow up with a full application later. The procedures for pre-file conferences, user fees, and delayed applications can be found in Rev. Proc. 96-53. The APA application can be a relatively modest document for a small business taxpayer. Notice 98-65 describes the special APA procedures for small businesses. For most taxpayers, however, the APA application is a substantial document filling several binders. The APA Program makes every effort to reach agreement on the basis of the information provided in the taxpayer's application. The application is assigned to an APA team leader who is responsible for the case. The APA team leader’s first responsibility is to organize the APA team. This involves contacting the appropriate LMSB International Territory Manager to secure the assignment of an international examiner to the APA case and the LMSB Counsel’s office to secure a field counsel lawyer. In a bilateral case, the U.S. Competent Authority will assign a U.S. Competent Authority analyst to the team. In a large APA case, the international examiner may invite his or her manager and other LMSB personnel familiar with the taxpayer to join the team. When the APA may affect taxable years in Appeals, the appropriate appellate conferee will be invited to join the team. In all cases, the team leader contacts the Manager, LMSB International Technical Advisors, to determine whether to include a technical advisor on the team. The IRS APA team will generally include a technical advisor if the APA request concerns cost-sharing, intangibles or services. The APA team leader then distributes copies of the APA application to all team members and sets up an opening conference with the taxpayer. The APA office strives to hold this opening conference within 45 days of the assignment of the case to a team leader.

"conference, the APA team leader proposes a case plan designed to complete the recommended U.S. negotiating position for a bilateral APA within 9 months from the date the full application was filed and to complete a unilateral APA within 12 months from the application date. In 2002, the median for completing negotiating positions was 12.0 months (average 13.7), and the median for completing unilateral APAs was 15.9 months (average 20.2). (2) Due Diligence The APA team must satisfy itself that the relevant facts submitted by the taxpayer are complete and accurate. This due diligence aspect of the APA is vital to the process. It is because of this due diligence that the IRS can reach advance agreements with taxpayers in the highly factual setting of transfer pricing. Due diligence can proceed in a number of ways. Typically, the taxpayer and the APA team will agree to dates for future meetings during the opening conference. In advance of the opening conference, the APA team leader will submit a list of questions to the taxpayer for discussion. The opening conference may result in a second set of questions. These questions are developed by the APA team and provided to the taxpayer through the APA team leader. It is important to note that this due diligence is not an audit and is focused on the transfer pricing issues associated with the transactions in the taxpayer’s application, or such other transactions that the taxpayer and the IRS may agree to add. (3) Analysis A significant part of the analytical work associated with an APA is done typically by the APA or IRS field economist assigned to the case. The analysis may result in the need for additional information. Once the IRS APA team has completed its due diligence and analysis, it begins negotiations with the taxpayer over the various aspects of the APA including the selection of comparable transactions, asset intensity and other adjustments, the TPM, which transactions to cover, the appropriate critical assumptions, the APA term, and other key issues. The APA team leader will discuss particularly difficult issues with his or her managers, but generally the APA team leader is empowered to negotiate the APA. (4) Discussion and Agreement This phase differs for bilateral and unilateral cases. In a bilateral case, the discussions proceed in two parts and involve two IRS offices -- the APA Program and the U.S. Competent Authority. In the first part, the APA team will attempt to reach a consensus with the taxpayer regarding the recommended position that the U.S. Competent Authority should take in negotiations with its treaty partner. This recommended U.S. negotiating position is a paper drafted by the APA team leader and signed by the APA Director that provides the APA Program’s view of the best TPM for the covered transaction, taking into account IRC § 482 and the regulations thereunder, the relevant tax treaty, and the U.S. Competent Authority’s experience with the treaty partner. The experience of the APA office and the U.S. Competent Authority is that APA negotiations are likely to proceed more rapidly with a foreign competent authority if the taxpayer fully supports the U.S. negotiating position. Consequently, the APA Office works together with the taxpayer in developing the recommended U.S. negotiating position. On occasion, the APA team",H2,3.0,42.0,12.0,12.0,1,0,7.0,0.043209876543209874,12.0,1.0,12.0,1.0,546.0,3347.0,5.131868131868132,71.50801086425781,71.99990844726562,469.7980651855469,634.2839813232422,1,1,1.0150638926944864,0,2.0,0.04750522856289214,0.007469375560203167,0.023304451747833882,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.575091575091575,0.6050955414012739,0.043860785486798795,0.0

"will agree to disagree with a taxpayer. In these cases, the APA office will send a recommended U.S. negotiating position to the U.S. Competent Authority that includes elements with which the taxpayer does not agree. This disagreement is noted in the paper. The APA team leader also solicits the views of the field members of the APA team, and, in the vast majority of APA cases, the international examiner, LMSB field counsel, and other IRS field team members concur in the position prepared by the APA team leader. Once the APA Program completes the recommended U.S. negotiating position, the APA process shifts from the APA Program to the U.S. Competent Authority. The U.S. Competent Authority analyst assigned to the APA takes the recommended U.S. negotiating position and prepares the final U.S. negotiating position, which is then transmitted to the foreign competent authority. The negotiations with the foreign competent authority are conducted by the U.S. Competent Authority analyst, most often in face-to-face negotiating sessions conducted periodically throughout the year. At the request of the U.S. Competent Authority analyst, the APA team leader may continue to assist the negotiations. In unilateral APA cases, the discussions proceed solely between the APA Program and the taxpayer. In a unilateral case, the taxpayer and the APA Program must reach agreement to conclude an APA. Like the bilateral cases, the APA team leader almost always will achieve a consensus with the IRS field personnel assigned to the APA team regarding the final APA. The APA Program has a procedure in which the IRS field personnel are solicited formally for their concurrence in the final APA. This concurrence, or any items in disagreement, is noted in a cover memorandum prepared by the APA team leader that accompanies the final APA sent forward for review and execution. (5) Drafting, Review, and Execution Once the IRS and the taxpayer reach agreement, the drafting of the final APA generally takes little time because the APA Program has developed standard language that is incorporated into every APA. The current version of this language is found in Attachment A. APAs are reviewed by the Branch Chief and the APA Director. In addition, the team leader prepares a summary memorandum for the Associate Chief Counsel (International) (ACC(I)). On March 1, 2001, the ACC(I) delegated to the APA Director the authority to execute APAs on behalf of the IRS. See Chief Counsel Notice CC-2001-016. The APA is executed for the taxpayer by an appropriate corporate officer. Model APA at Attachment A [§ 521(b)(2)(B)] Attachment A contains the current version of the model APA language. As part of its continuing effort to improve its work product, the APA Program has revised the model language to reflect the program’s collective experience with substantive and drafting issues.",H1,4.0,37.0,12.048648653803644,13.800000190734863,1,0,9.0,0.05555555555555555,12.0,1.0,12.0,1.0,460.0,2871.0,5.243478260869566,71.50801086425781,71.99996948242188,468.4611511230469,595.2839813232422,1,1,1.0191790170198425,0,2.0,0.07035876001393243,0.0059212817833507484,0.029954719609892023,0,0,0.0,1.0,0,0,1,1,0.6021739130434782,0.5740072202166066,0.05662105650110236,0.9444444444444444

"The Current APA Office Structure, Composition, and Operation In 2002, the APA Office consisted of four branches with Branches 1 and 3 staffed with APA team leaders and Branch 2 staffed with economists and a paralegal. 1 Branch 4, the APA West Coast branch, opened an additional office in Laguna Niguel and moved its headquarters there. Its staffing is indicated in the chart below. Overall, the APA staff decreased from 38 to 34 as a result of attrition and transfers to other Chief Counsel functions. The number of APA team leaders decreased from 22 to 17, while the number of economists remained constant at 7. Despite the decrease in the number of APA team leaders, the combination of the APA Program’s extensive training and smaller caseloads per APA team leader increased productivity and the currency of the APA inventory. As of December 31, 2002, the APA staff was as follows: Director’s Office 1 Acting Director (also Chief, Branch 1) 1 Special Counsel to the Director 1 Secretary to the Director Branch 1 1 Branch Chief 1 Secretary 8 Team Leaders",H1,5.0,19.0,12.02105264496385,13.800000190734863,1,0,11.0,0.06790123456790123,12.0,1.0,12.0,573.0,180.0,1055.0,4.866666666666666,72.3041763305664,71.99998474121094,469.04994201660156,328.6877975463867,1,1,1.0168447076735299,0,2.0,0.07014218009478673,0.03033175355450237,0.02085308056872038,1,0,2.0,0.0,0,0,1,1,0.5777777777777777,0.6538461538461539,0.0690450110148693,1.8641975308641976

"2 Approximately half of the 58 bilateral APAs executed in 2002 regarded companies carrying on limited business activities. These APAs were negotiated based on a bilateral competent authority agreement that established streamlined resolution guidelines. 3 In 2002, the APA Office and taxpayers agreed to amend nine APAs (seven unilateral and two bilateral). In six of these, the taxpayer reorganized its business. In three, the changes reflected technical corrections or modifications to minor aspects of the APA. 4 In the history of the APA Program, five APAs have been canceled and no APAs have been revoked. 5 Reasons for withdrawals included jurisdictional issues, inventory corrections, taxpayer reorganizations, and changes in facts and circumstances.",Paragraph,6.0,9.0,9.466666495358503,10.199999809265137,1,0,32.0,0.19753086419753085,11.720000012715657,27.0,12.0,1.0,112.0,756.0,5.758928571428571,604.7117919921875,72.0,467.8502197265625,115.09136962890625,0,1,0.8007726119682561,0,2.0,0.04365079365079365,0.018518518518518517,0.021164021164021163,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.6160714285714286,0.8840579710144928,0.15817730606780367,0.0

"Discussion The vast majority of APAs have covered transactions that involve numerous business functions and risks. For instance, with respect to functions, companies that manufacture products have typically conducted research and development, engaged in product design and engineering, manufactured the product, marketed and distributed the product, and performed support functions such as legal, finance, and human resources services. Regarding risks, companies have been subject to market risks, R&D risks, financial risks, credit and collection risks, product liability risks, and general business risks. In the APA evaluation process a significant amount of time and effort is devoted to understanding how the functions and risks are allocated amongst the controlled group of companies that are party to the covered transactions. In its APA submission, the taxpayer must provide a functional analysis. The functional analysis identifies the economic activities performed, the assets employed, the economic costs incurred, and the risks assumed by each of the controlled parties. The importance of the functional analysis derives from the fact that economic theory posits that there is a positive relationship between risk and expected return and that different functions provide different value and have different opportunity costs associated with them. It is important that the functional analysis go beyond simply categorizing the tested party as, say, a distributor. It should provide more specific information since, in the example of distributors, not all distributors undertake similar functions and risks. Thus, the functional analysis is critical in determining the TPM (including the selection of comparables). Although functional comparability is an essential factor in evaluating the reliability of the TPM (including the selection of comparables), the APA evaluation process also involves consideration of economic conditions such as the economic condition of the particular industry. In evaluating the functional analysis, the APA program considers contractual terms between the controlled parties and the consistency of the conduct of the parties with respect to the allocation of risk. In accord with the section 482 regulations, the APA program also gives consideration to the ability of controlled parties to fund losses that might be expected to occur as the result of the assumption of risk. Another relevant factor considered in evaluating the functional analysis is the extent to which each controlled party exercises managerial or operational control over the business activities that directly influence the amount of income or loss realized. The section 482 regulations posit that parties at arm's length will ordinarily bear a greater share of those risks over which they have relatively more control.

Under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-3, the arm’s length amount for controlled transfers of tangible property may be determined using the Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method, the Resale Price Method, the Cost Plus Method, the Comparable Profits Method (CPM), or the Profit Split method. Under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-4, the arm’s length amount for controlled transfers of intangible property may be determined using the Comparable Uncontrolled Transaction (CUT) method, CPM, or the Profit Split Method. An “Unspecified Method” may be used for both tangible and intangible property if it provides a more reliable result than the enumerated methods under the best method rule of Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(c). For transfers involving the provision of services, Treas. Reg. § 1.482-2(b) provides that services performed for the benefit of another member of a controlled group should bear an arm’s length charge, either deemed to be equal to the cost of providing the services (when non-integral) or which should be an amount that would have been charged between independent parties. In addition, Treas. Reg. § 1.482-2(a) provides rules concerning the proper treatment of loans or advances, and Treas. Reg. § 1.482-7 provides rules for qualified cost sharing arrangements under which the parties agree to share the costs of development of intangibles in proportion to their shares of reasonably anticipated benefits. APAs involving cost sharing arrangements generally address both the method of allocating costs among the parties as well as determining the appropriate amount of the “buy-in” payment due for the transfer of intangibles to the controlled participants. In reviewing the TPMs applicable to transfers of tangible and intangible property reflected in Table 16, the majority of the APAs followed the specified methods. However, there are several distinguishing points that should be made. The Regulations note that for transfers of tangible property, the Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method will generally be the most direct and reliable measure of an arm’s length price for the controlled transaction if sufficiently reliable comparable transactions can be identified. Treas. Reg. § 1.482-3(b)(2)(ii)(A). It was the experience of the APA Program in Year 2002 that in the cases that come into the APA Program, sufficiently reliable CUP transactions are difficult to find. In APAs executed in Year 2002, there were five covered transactions that used the CUP method; three looked to published market data and two used internal data on transactions between the taxpayer and unrelated parties.",H3,14.0,48.0,12.008333337306977,12.400000190734863,1,0,65.0,0.4012345679012346,12.0,2.0,12.0,2.0,468.0,2934.0,5.271367521367521,72.3041763305664,72.0,472.800048828125,635.8875961303711,1,1,1.0157687985116495,0,2.0,0.06100886162235856,0.02147239263803681,0.03578732106339468,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,1,1,0.6047008547008547,0.6113074204946997,0.40756155495837787,0.0

"Similar to the CUP method, for transfers of intangible property, the CUT method will generally provide the most reliable measure of an arm’s length result if sufficiently reliable comparables may be found. Treas. Reg. § 1.482-4(c)(2)(ii). It has generally been difficult to identify external comparables, and APAs using the CUT method tend to rely on internal transactions between the taxpayer and unrelated parties. In Year 2002, there were eight covered transactions that utilized the CUT TPM. The Cost Plus Method (tangibles only) and Resale Price Method were applied in Year 2002 in five and eight APAs respectively. See Treas. Reg. § 1.482-3(c), (d). The CPM is frequently applied in APAs. This is because reliable public data on comparable business activities of independent companies may be more readily available than potential CUP data, and comparability of resources employed, functions, risks, and other relevant considerations is more likely to exist than comparability of product. The CPM also tends to be less sensitive than other methods to differences in accounting practices between the tested party and comparable companies, e.g., classification of expenses as cost of goods sold or operating expenses. Treas. Reg. § 1.482-3(c)(3)(iii)(B), and -3(d)(3)(iii)(B). In addition, the degree of functional comparability required to obtain a reliable result under the CPM is generally less than required under the Resale Price or Cost Plus methods, because differences in functions performed often are reflected in operating expenses, and thus taxpayers performing different functions may have very different gross profit margins but earn similar levels of operating profit. Treas. Reg. § 1.482-5(c)(2). Table 16 reflects 35 uses of the CPM (with varying PLIs) in covered transactions involving tangible or intangible property. The CPM was also used in some APAs concurrently with other methods. The CPM has proven to be versatile in part because of the various PLIs that can be used in connection with the method. Reaching agreement on the appropriate PLI has been the subject of much discussion in many of the cases, and it depends heavily on the facts and circumstances. Some APAs have called for different PLIs to apply to different parts of the covered transactions or with one PLI used as a check against the primary PLI. The CPM also was used regularly with services as the covered transactions in APAs executed in Year 2002. There were a total of fifteen services covered transactions using the CPM method with various PLIs according to the specific facts of the taxpayers involved. Table 17 reflects the methods used to determine the arm’s length results for APAs involving services transactions. In Year 2002, there were fourteen APAs involving tangible or intangible property that used the residual profit split, Treas. Reg. § 1.482-6(c)(3). In residual profit split cases, routine contributions by the controlled parties are allocated routine market returns, and the residual income is allocated among the controlled taxpayers based upon the relative value of their contributions of intangible property to the relevant business activity.",Paragraph,15.0,37.0,12.0,12.0,1,0,67.0,0.41358024691358025,12.0,2.0,12.0,2.0,490.0,3160.0,5.451020408163266,71.50801086425781,71.99996948242188,471.0005187988281,592.8836517333984,1,1,1.0150638926944864,0,2.0,0.04177215189873418,0.016772151898734176,0.03481012658227848,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.6122448979591837,0.6366666666666667,0.41981037537364563,0.0

A critical assumption is any fact (whether or not within the control of the taxpayer) related to the taxpayer, a third party, an industry, or business and economic conditions, the continued existence of which is material to the taxpayer's proposed TPM. Critical assumptions might include, for example, a particular mode of conducting business operations, a particular corporate or business structure, or a range of expected business volume. Rev. Proc. 96-53, § 5.07. Failure to meet a critical assumption may render an APA inappropriate or unworkable. A critical assumption may change (and/or fail to materialize) due to uncontrollable changes in economic circumstances, such as a fundamental and dramatic change in the economic conditions of a particular industry. In addition, a critical assumption may change (and/or fail to materialize) due to a taxpayer's actions that are initiated for good faith business reasons, such as a change in business strategy, mode of conducting operations, or the cessation or transfer of a business segment or entity covered by the APA. If a critical assumption has not been met, the APA may be revised by agreement of the parties. If such agreement cannot be achieved, the APA may be canceled. If a critical assumption has not been met, it requires taxpayer's notice to and discussion with the Service, and, in the case of a bilateral APA, competent authority consideration. Rev.

The APA program works closely with taxpayers to find the best and most reliable comparables for each covered transaction. In some cases, CUPs or CUTs can be identified. In other cases, comparable business activities of independent companies are utilized in applying the CPM or residual profit split methods. Generally, in the APA Program's experience since 1991, CUPs and CUTs have been most often derived from the internal transactions of the taxpayer. For profit-based methods in which comparable business activities or functions of independent companies are sought, the APA Program typically has applied a three-part process. First, a pool of potential comparables has been identified through broad searches. From this pool, companies having transactions that are clearly not comparable to those of the tested party have been eliminated through the use of quantitative and qualitative analyses, i.e., quantitative screens and business descriptions. Then, based on a review of available descriptive and financial data, a set",H3,18.0,25.0,12.0,12.0,0,0,78.0,0.48148148148148145,11.948148150502899,382.0,9.299999833106995,204.0,181.0,1198.0,5.624309392265193,360.1080017089844,68.4000015258789,469.7000961303711,312.0839538574219,0,1,1.0150638926944864,0,0.0,0.037562604340567615,0.009181969949916527,0.021702838063439065,0,0,2.0,0.0,0,0,1,1,0.5580110497237569,0.8316831683168316,0.48873446685290084,1.0370370370370372

"of comparable transactions or business activities of independent companies has been finalized. The comparability of the finalized set has then been enhanced through the application of adjustments. Sources of Comparables Comparables used in APAs can be U.S. or foreign. This depends on the relevant market, the type of transaction being evaluated, and the results of the functional and risk analyses. In general, comparables have been located by searching a variety of databases that provide data on U.S. publicly traded companies and on a combination of public and private non-U.S. companies. Table 19 shows the various databases and other sources used in selecting comparables for the APAs executed in Year 2002. Although comparables were most often identified from the databases cited in Table 19, in some cases comparables were found from other sources, such as comparables derived internally from taxpayer transactions with third parties. Selecting Comparables Initial pools of potential comparables generally are derived from the databases using a combination of industry and keyword identifiers. Then, the pool is refined using a variety of selection criteria specific to the transaction or business activity being tested and the TPM being used. The listed databases allow for searches by industrial classification, by keywords, or by both. These searches can yield a number of companies whose business activities may or may not be comparable to those of the entity being tested. Therefore, comparables based solely on industry classification or keyword searches are rarely used in APAs. Instead, the pool of comparables is examined closely, and companies are selected based on a combination of screens, business descriptions, and other information found in the companies’ Annual Reports to shareholders and filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Business activities are required to meet certain basic comparability criteria to be considered comparables. Functions, risks, economic conditions, and the property (product or intangible) and services associated with the transaction must be comparable. Determining comparability can be difficult – the goal has been to use comparability criteria restrictive enough to eliminate business activities that are not comparable, but yet not so restrictive as to have no comparables remaining. The APA Program normally has begun with relatively strict comparability criteria and then has relaxed them slightly if necessary to derive a pool of reliable comparables. A determination on the appropriate size of the comparables set, as well as the business activities that comprise the set, is highly fact specific and depends on the reliability of the results. In addition, the APA Program, consistent with the section 482 regulations, generally has looked at the results of comparables over a multi-year period. Sometimes this has been three years, but it has been more or less, depending on the circumstances of the controlled transaction. Using a shorter period might result in the inclusion of comparables in different stages of economic",H2,19.0,38.0,12.0,12.0,0,0,81.0,0.5,12.0,2.0,12.0,2.0,469.0,3109.0,5.631130063965885,71.50801086425781,71.99993896484375,470.88690185546875,634.2837982177734,1,1,1.0150638926944864,0,0.0,0.019942103570279833,0.003538115149565777,0.01929880990672242,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.55863539445629,0.7175572519083969,0.5075319463472432,0.0

"development or use of atypical years of a comparable subject to cyclical fluctuations in business conditions. Many covered transactions have been tested with comparables that have been chosen using additional criteria and/or screens. These include sales level criteria and tests for financial distress and product comparability. These common selection criteria and screens have been used to increase the overall comparability of a group of companies and as a basis for further research. The sales level screen, for example, has been used to remove companies that, due to their size, might face fundamentally different economic conditions from those of the transaction or business activities being tested. In addition, APA analyses have incorporated selection criteria related to removing companies experiencing ""financial distress"" due to concerns that companies in financial distress often have experienced unusual circumstances that would render them not comparable to the business activity being tested. These criteria include: an unfavorable auditor's opinion, bankruptcy, and in certain circumstances, operating losses in a given number of years. An additional important class of selection criteria is the development and ownership of intangible property. In some cases in which the business activity being tested is a manufacturer, several criteria have been used to ensure, for example, that if the controlled entity does not own significant manufacturing intangibles or conduct research and development (R&D), then neither will the comparables. These selection criteria have included determining the importance of patents to a company or screening for R&D expenditures as a percentage of sales. Again, quantitative screens related to identifying comparables with significant intangible property generally have been used in conjunction with an understanding of the comparable derived from publicly available business information. Selection criteria relating to asset comparability and operating expense comparability have also been used at times. A screen of property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) as a percentage of sales or assets, combined with a reading of a company's SEC filings, has been used to help ensure that distributors (generally lower PP&E) were not compared with manufacturers (generally higher PP&E), regardless of their industry classification. Similarly, a test involving the ratio of operating expenses to sales has helped to determine whether a company undertakes a significant marketing and distribution function. Table 22 shows the number of times various screens were used in APAs executed in Year 2002:",Paragraph,20.0,30.0,12.0,12.0,0,0,83.0,0.5123456790123457,12.0,2.0,12.0,2.0,382.0,2633.0,5.895287958115183,71.50801086425781,72.0,470.4000244140625,485.2723846435547,1,1,1.0150638926944864,0,0.0,0.01405241169768325,0.002278769464489176,0.020129130269654388,1,0,0.0,1.0,0,0,0,0,0.599476439790576,0.7554585152838428,0.5200635993434715,0.48765432098765427

Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(d)(2). In almost all cases involving income-statement-based PLIs, certain ""asset intensity"" or ""balance sheet"" adjustments for factors that have generally agreed-upon effects on profits are calculated. In addition, in specific cases, additional adjustments are performed to improve reliability. The most common balance sheet adjustments used in APAs are adjustments for differences in accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable. The APA Program generally has required adjustments for receivables, inventory, and payables based on the principle that there is an opportunity cost for holding assets. For these assets it is generally assumed that the cost is a short-term debt interest rate. To compare the profits of two business activities with different relative levels of receivables, inventory, or payables, the APA Program estimates the carrying costs of each item and adjusts profits accordingly. Although different formulas have been used in specific APA cases, Attachment B presents one set of formulas used in many APAs. Underlying these formulas are the notions that (1) balance sheet items should be expressed as mid-year averages, (2) formulas should try to avoid using data items that are being tested by the TPM (for example, if sales are controlled, then the denominator of the balance sheet ratio should not be sales), (3) a short-term interest rate should be used, and (4) an interest factor should recognize the average holding period of the relevant asset.",H2,21.0,52.0,12.008974362642336,12.46666685740153,1,0,85.0,0.5246913580246914,12.0,2.0,12.0,2.0,340.0,2228.0,5.555882352941176,72.3041763305664,68.4000015258789,470.29195404052734,638.2876815795898,1,1,1.015823021984335,0,2.0,0.039946140035906644,0.013464991023339317,0.035457809694793535,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,1,1,0.6058823529411764,0.7475728155339806,0.5329935609177066,0.0

"The APA Program also requires that data be compared on a consistent accounting basis. For example, although financial statements may be prepared on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis, cross-company comparisons are less meaningful if one or more of the comparables use LIFO inventory accounting methods. This adjustment directly affects costs of goods sold and inventories, and therefore affects both profitability measures and inventory adjustments. Still important in some cases is the adjustment for differences in relative levels of PP&E between a tested business activity and the comparables. Ideally, comparables and the business activity being tested will have fairly similar relative levels of PP&E, since major differences can be a sign of fundamentally different functions and risks. Typically, the PP&E adjustment is made using a medium term interest rate. Additional adjustments used less frequently include those for differences in other balance sheet items, operating expenses, R&D, or currency risk. Accounting adjustments, such as reclassifying items from cost of goods sold to operating expenses, for example, are also made when warranted to increase reliability. Often, data is not available for both the controlled and uncontrolled transactions in sufficient detail to allow for these types of adjustments. The adjustments made to comparables or tested parties in APAs executed in Year 2002 are reflected in table 21 above.

"Discussion Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(1 ) states that sometimes a pricing method will yield ""a single result that is the most reliable measure of an arm's length result."" Sometimes, however, a method may yield ""a range of reliable results,"" called the ""arm's length range."" A taxpayer whose results fall within the arm's length range will not be subject to adjustment. Under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(2)(i), such a range is normally derived by considering a set of more than one comparable uncontrolled transaction of similar comparability and reliability. If these comparables are of very high quality, as defined in the Regulations, then under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(A), the arm's length range includes the results of all of the comparables (from the least to the greatest). However, the APA Program has only rarely identified cases meeting the requirements for the full range. If the comparables are of lesser quality, then under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(B), ""the reliability of the analysis must be increased, when it is possible to do so, by adjusting the range through application of a valid statistical method to the results of all of the uncontrolled comparables."" One such method, the ""interquartile range,"" is ordinarily acceptable, although a different statistical method ""may be applied if it provides a more reliable measure."" The ""interquartile range"" is defined as, roughly, the range from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the comparables' results. See Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(C). The interquartile range was used 39 times in Year 2002. Nineteen covered transactions reflected on Table 23 specified a single, specific result, or ""point."" Ten of these covered transactions involved a CPM in which the taxpayer agreed to a specific result. Some APAs specify not a point or a range, instead using a ""floor"" that requires the tested party's result be greater than or equal to some particular value. Four APAs executed in Year 2002 used a floor. Some APAs look to a tested party’s results over a period of years (multi-year averaging) to determine whether a taxpayer has complied with the APA. In 2002, rolling multi-year averaging was used for twelve covered transactions. Eleven of those used three-year averages, and the other one used a five-year average. Cumulative multi-year averages were used for two covered transactions. Of those two transactions, one used a five-year average, and one used a seven-year average. Additionally, nine covered transactions used term averages. Adjustments Under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(3), if a taxpayer's results fall outside the arm's length range, the Service may adjust the result ""to any point within the arm's length range."" Accordingly, an APA may permit or require a taxpayer and its related parties to make an adjustment after the year's end to put the year's results within the range, or at the point specified by the APA. Similarly, to enforce the terms of an APA, the Service may make such an adjustment. When the APA specifies a range, the adjustment is sometimes to the closest edge of the range, and sometimes to another point such as the median of the interquartile range. Depending on the facts of each case, such automatic adjustments are not always permitted. APAs may specify that in such a case there will be a negotiation between the competent authorities involved to determine whether and to what extent an adjustment should be made. APAs may permit automatic adjustments unless",Paragraph,23.0,40.0,12.0,12.0,0,0,91.0,0.5617283950617284,12.0,2.0,12.0,2.0,558.0,3477.0,5.232974910394265,71.50801086425781,71.99996948242188,470.9999084472656,634.2839813232422,1,1,1.0150638926944864,0,0.0,0.02444636180615473,0.01610583836640782,0.04946793212539546,0,0,2.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.5770609318996416,0.6366459627329193,0.5701902113283844,0.8765432098765431

"the result is far outside the range specified in the APA. Thus APAs provide flexibility and efficiency, permitting adjustments when normal business fluctuations and uncertainties push the result somewhat outside the range. In order to conform the taxpayer's books to these tax adjustments, the APA usually permits a ""compensating adjustment"" as long as certain requirements are met. Such compensating adjustments may be paid between the related parties with no interest, and the amount transferred will not be considered for purposes of penalties for failure to pay estimated tax.

"Approaches for Sharing of Currency or Other Risks [§ 521(b)(2)(D)(xii)] During Year 2002, there were 38 tested parties that faced financial risks, including interest rate and currency risks. Eleven APAs provide specific approaches for dealing with currency risk, including adjustment mechanisms and critical assumptions. Efforts to Ensure Compliance with APAs [§ 521(b)(2)(F)] As described in Rev. Proc. 96-53, section 11, APA taxpayers are required to file annual reports to demonstrate compliance with the terms and conditions of the APA. The filing and review of annual reports is a critical part of the APA process. Through annual report review, the APA program monitors taxpayer compliance with the APA on a contemporaneous basis. Annual report review provides current information on the success or problems associated with the various TPMs adopted in the APA process. All reports received by the APA Office are tracked by one designated APA team leader who also has the primary responsibility for annual report review. One of the economists also spends a significant amount of time reviewing annual reports. Other APA team leaders also assist in this review, especially when the team leader who negotiated the case is available, since that person will already be familiar with the relevant facts and terms of the agreement. Once received by the APA Office, the annual report is sent out to the district personnel with exam jurisdiction over the taxpayer. The statistics for the review of APA annual reports are reflected in Table 28 below. As of December 31, 2002, there were 101 pending annual reports. In Year 2002, there were 330 reports closed.

"The Special Education School District Data Profile is prepared in accordance with the requirement of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Each State must have a State Performance Plan (SPP) to evaluate the State's efforts to meet the requirements and purposes of the implementation of IDEA. The SPP is a six-year plan which describes New York State's performance on 20 indicators. States must report annually to the public on the performance of the State in an Annual Performance Report (APR) and each school district against the State's targets. New York State's SPP and the APR that describe these indicators in detail are available at http://www.vesid.nysed.gov/specialed/spp/home.html . The following report reflects only quantifiable data collected by the State. Since performance of a school district in any indicator may be the result of unique circumstances within a district, readers are encouraged to consider information provided by the district's administration in interpreting these data.",Paragraph,0.0,7.0,7.998046875,7.998046875,0,0,4.0,0.020618556701030927,13.7109375,58.0,10.283203125,34.0,152.0,1020.0,5.717105263157895,123.40422821044922,6.7138671875,577.7631225585938,72.36861419677734,1,1,0.9845823986515797,0,0.0,0.054901960784313725,0.00196078431372549,0.029411764705882353,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,1,0,0,0.5855263157894737,0.7528089887640449,0.020300668013434633,0.0

"GENERAL INFORMATION The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires the Massachusetts Division of Banks (the “Division”) to use its authority when examining financial institutions subject to its supervision, to assess the institution's record of meeting the needs of its entire assessment area, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operation of the institution. Upon conclusion of such examination, the Division must prepare a written evaluation of the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community. This document is an evaluation of the CRA performance of BARRE SAVINGS BANK, prepared by the Division, the institution's supervisory agency, as of JUNE 23, 2004 . The Division evaluates performance in the assessment area(s), as they are defined by the institution, rather than individual branches. This assessment area evaluation may include the visits to some, but not necessarily all of the institution’s branches. The Division rates the CRA performance of an institution consistent with the provisions set forth in 209 CMR 46.00. INSTITUTION'S CRA RATING: This institution is rated ""Satisfactory"" The Bank’s overall CRA rating is based upon its performance under the five criteria contained herein. The following is a summarization of the findings, presented in descending order of weight given to each criteria, that were utilized in formulating the bank’s overall CRA rating: Distribution of Credit among Different Income Levels There was a substantial distribution of HMDA-reportable lending to individuals of low- and moderate-income, given the demographics of the Bank’s assessment area. Comparison of Credit Extended Inside And Outside of the Assessment Area(s) A majority of the Bank’s HMDA-reportable lending was originated inside its assessment area. Loan to Deposit Analysis The Bank was determined to have a reasonable level of net loan to deposit ratios over the eight quarter period reviewed. Geographic Distribution of Loans The Bank made a strong penetration of HMDA-reportable lending to the middle-income census tracts in its assessment area. There are no low- or moderate-income census tracts within the Bank’s assessment area. Review of Complaints/Fair Lending Policies and Practices The Bank’s fair lending policies and practices are considered reasonable. No weight was given to a review of complaints, as none have been received since the prior examination.",H2,1.0,32.0,10.979999542236328,10.979999542236328,1,0,8.0,0.061068702290076333,10.979999542236328,308.0,11.489999771118164,1.0,362.0,2445.0,5.7569060773480665,42.32353973388672,71.99983215332031,471.09812927246094,622.5085525512695,1,1,1.0667787696964968,0,2.0,0.06094069529652352,0.005316973415132925,0.027402862985685072,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.6077348066298343,0.7136363636363636,0.06514679509596927,0.0

"3. DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT AMONG DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS Based upon the subsequent analysis, the Bank’s distribution of its HMDA-reportable lending within its assessment area to borrowers of different incomes is considered to be substantial. Therefore, the Bank was determined to exceed the standards for satisfactory performance in this criterion. An analysis of HMDA-reportable lending extended within the Bank’s assessment area, among various income levels for the period under review, was performed. Originations were categorized by the ratio of the applicants’ reported incomes to the 2002 and 2003 estimated median family incomes of the appropriate MSA (refer to the Performance Context Section). Low-income is defined by the US Census Bureau as income below 50 percent of the median family income level for the MSA; moderate-income is defined as 50 to 79 percent of the median family income; middle-income is defined as income between 80 and 119 percent of the median family income; and upper-income is defined as income greater than 120 percent of the median family income. The following analysis also includes 2002 aggregate data (exclusive of Barre Savings Bank) of HMDA-reportable lending by percentage, as well as demographic data on the percentage of households (per 1990 and 2000 census data) in the assessment area in each respective income group.

"DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT AMONG DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS (continued) As indicated in the table, the Bank’s percentage of lending to low- and moderate-income borrowers is significantly above that of the aggregate in 2002. For calendar year 2003, the percentage of lending in the low-income category has increased, while the percentage of lending in the moderate- income category declined somewhat. By dollar volume in 2002, the Bank originated 1.3 percent of its HMDA-reportable lending to low- income borrowers, exceeding the 2002 aggregate data by dollar volume of 0.9 percent to low- income borrowers. Lending by dollar volume to moderate-income borrowers was 14.0 percent, while aggregate lending was 7.5 percent to those borrowers in 2002. For calendar year 2003, the Bank’s HMDA-reportable lending by dollar volume was 2.5 percent to low-income borrowers and 13.0 percent to moderate-income borrowers. Also of particular note is the marked increase in the dollar volume of loans granted in these two income categories. Therefore, over the period reviewed the Bank’s level of HMDA-reportable lending to borrowers of low- and moderate-income is considered to be significant.",H2,8.0,14.0,10.979999542236328,10.979999542236328,1,0,92.0,0.7022900763358778,11.489999771118164,1.0,11.489999771118164,1.0,177.0,1173.0,5.632768361581921,29.423147201538086,72.0,471.03662109375,251.88782691955566,1,1,1.0667787696964968,0,2.0,0.058823529411764705,0.03239556692242114,0.03410059676044331,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.615819209039548,0.5596330275229358,0.7491881436036465,0.0

"4. GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LOANS The following analysis indicates that the Bank appears to have achieved a reasonable penetration of its HMDA-reportable lending to the census tracts within its assessment area. Therefore, the Bank was determined to meet the standards for satisfactory performance at this time. Based upon both 1990 and 2000 census data, the Bank’s assessment area contained eleven census tracts. Of those tracts, four (36.4 percent) are middle-income, and seven (63.6 percent) are upper-income. There are no low- or moderate-income census tracts within the Bank’s assessment area. Further, an analysis of the Bank’s HMDA-reportable lending extended within the various census tracts contained within its assessment area for calendar year 2003 was also conducted. It should be noted that, as of January 1, 2003, a revision to Regulation C (HMDA reporting) went into effect. This revision states in part…”For all applications and loans reported on lenders’ 2003 HMDA/LARs, lenders must use the census tract numbers and corresponding geographic areas from the 2000 census.” An analysis of HMDA-reportable lending extended within the various census tracts contained within the Bank’s assessment area was also conducted. The following table presents the Bank’s performance, as well as the 2002 aggregate data (exclusive of Barre Savings Bank) of HMDA- reportable lending by percentage. In addition, the table also reflects the percentage of owner- occupied housing units (per 1990 and 2000 census data) in each of the census tract income categories.",Paragraph,9.0,21.0,10.979999542236328,10.979999542236328,1,0,94.0,0.7175572519083969,11.489999771118164,1.0,10.020000457763672,74.0,236.0,1562.0,5.622881355932203,29.423147201538086,72.0,471.06463623046875,315.6653537750244,1,1,1.0667787696964968,0,2.0,0.051856594110115235,0.028169014084507043,0.034571062740076826,0,1,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,1,0.6567796610169492,0.6580645161290323,0.7654748423776389,0.0

For that period, the percentage of the Bank’s HMDA-reportable lending was consistently and significantly above both the aggregate and the demographic data. By dollar volume in 2002, the Bank originated 55.8 percent of its HMDA-reportable lending to the middle-income tracts. This was also well above the 2002 aggregate data by dollar volume of 32.4 percent to those tracts. In 2003, the Bank had 57.4 percent of the dollar volume of its HMDA- reportable lending going to the middle-income census tracts. In conclusion, although lacking low- and moderate-income census tracts within its assessment area, the Bank’s penetration of its middle-income census tracts within its assessment area is considered to be very strong.",Paragraph,9.0,41.0,10.240975827705569,10.979999542236328,1,0,109.0,0.8320610687022901,10.020000457763672,4.0,11.489999771118164,1.0,167.0,1020.0,5.11377245508982,452.0919189453125,59.40000915527344,489.8418731689453,234.70013427734375,0,1,0.9949777822801449,0,2.0,0.03725490196078431,0.11078431372549019,0.045098039215686274,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,1,0,0.6467065868263473,0.6574074074074074,0.8278822768590519,0.0

"5. REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS/FAIR LENDING POLICIES AND PRACTICES The Bank received no CRA related complaints in the period under review. The Bank has a satisfactory record of implementing fair lending policies and practices. The following discussion is based on the guidelines of the Division’s Regulatory Bulletin 2-3-101. The institution’s loan policy prohibits discrimination against all the prohibited classes listed under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act. In the area of fair lending, the Bank’s compliance policy addresses second review and employee training. As a portfolio mortgage lender, the Bank offers 1-year (1/1), 3-year (3/3), 5-year (5/5), and 5/1 Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) products. In addition, the Bank offers 15-, 20-, and 30-year fixed rate mortgage loans. The maximum loan to value (LTV) for mortgage products is 95 percent, with private mortgage insurance required for LTV’s over 80 percent. All mortgage loan applications are underwritten to FNMA standards. The Bank’s first time homebuyer product consists of a discounted 5/1 ARM with a 95 percent loan to value (LTV), and expanded qualifying ratios. In the twelve months prior to this evaluation, the Bank originated 3 first time homebuyer 5/1 ARMs for a total of $403,000. In addition, the Bank promoted its mortgage products in November 2002, and again in March and April of 2003, by offering a reduced closing cost option via a special $500 off coupon. The coupons appeared in the Bank’s newspaper advertisements and on the Bank’s website. The Bank offers both Home Equity Loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC). Home Equity Loans have a fixed interest rate, a maximum term of 15 years and an 80 percent LTV. HELOCs have a variable rate (tied to the Prime Rate), a 10-year draw period (with a 15-year repayment term) and maximum LTV of 80 percent. Currently on HELOCs, the Bank offers two discounted interest rate options; the first is a 2.99% (for the first six months) and the second a 0% interest rate (for the first 2 months). The Bank continues to offer consumer loan products offerings including new and used automobile loans, unsecured personal loans, overdraft protection lines of credit, passbook loans, and other types of secured personal loans. Applications for Home Equity Loans and HELOCs, car loans, and overdraft protection are offered via the Bank’s website, www.barrebank.com. The Bank utilizes two local weekly publications, The Landmark, published in Holden, and The Barre Gazette, published in Barre, to advertise both its banking services and credit products. Both these publications are circulated in the towns within the Bank’s assessment area. In addition, the Bank periodically advertises its loan products in the Worcester Telegram and Gazette, which is circulated throughout all of Worcester County. In March of 2004, the Bank participated as an exhibitor in the Worcester County Home Show, held at the Worcester Centrum. It is the Bank’s policy to provide all staff members with ongoing training opportunities in order to keep staff informed of changes in banking regulations and to enhance job knowledge and skills. The Bank’s lending staff recently attended seminars on the changes to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and teleconference (and internet based) training on FNMA’s Desktop Underwriter program. There is a second review committee comprised of three members of senior management. The committee reviews all denied loan applications, including mortgage, equity, and consumer loan requests.",Paragraph,10.0,45.0,10.979999542236328,10.979999542236328,1,0,111.0,0.8473282442748091,11.489999771118164,1.0,11.489999771118164,2.0,555.0,3538.0,5.376576576576577,29.423147201538086,71.99947357177734,474.0883560180664,654.7890110015869,1,1,1.0667787696964968,0,2.0,0.05794234030525721,0.01978518937252685,0.035613340870548335,0,1,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.6486486486486487,0.6777777777777778,0.9039117819565735,0.0

"Survey for the Violence Against Women Act STOP Grant Program To help the Executive Office of Public Safety (EOPS) and the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Advisory Committee develop their Three Year Strategic Plan for the Massachusetts Violence Against Women Act STOP (Services, Training, Officers, Prosecutors) Grant Program, the EOPS is administering a survey to members of the criminal justice, court, local/state government, and victim advocate/victim services communities. The survey seeks respondents' views on the criminal justice system’s response to crimes of sexual assault, domestic violence, and stalking in Massachusetts, in a number of areas including: the needs of victims of crimes against women, VAWA program purpose areas, and underserved populations. The EOPS is particularly interested in the professional opinions of front-line staff. The survey takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete.

"Boston's New Problem: Stop Emerging Girl Gang ""Epidemic"" Boston Herald , May 12, 2006 According to the Boston Herald , Boston Mayor Thomas Menino is ordering new steps to stop the violence between gangs of young girls, including the addition of female police detectives to a special unit. The rise in violent crimes committed by teenage girls who associate or travel in loosely organized groups prompted Commissioner Kathleen O’Toole to ask for more female cops in the Youth Violence Strike Force. Teen girls were involved in at least four incidents of armed violence during the second week of May.

About $40,000 has been raised for the program, which details that people who turn in guns will be given $200 in Target gift cards. Gift cards will be used instead of cash because criminologists have found that in previous buyback programs, certain individuals used the buyback money to purchase newer guns.

"At the beginning of 2022, communities across South Sudan were suffering from three years of unprecedented flooding. Floods had become a year-round struggle, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation, where more than two-thirds of the population (almost 9 million people) needed humanitarian assistance. 1 Ongoing conflict and instability in the country combined with the flooding resulted in people being forced to leave their homes time and time again.",Paragraph,2.0,10.0,9.860999997456869,10.0,1,0,10.0,0.06666666666666667,10.0,392.0,10.0,679.0,68.0,463.0,5.823529411764706,203.44024658203125,304.92059326171875,232.26702880859375,139.26998901367188,0,0,1.0655584251282548,0,2.0,0.01079913606911447,0.012958963282937365,0.02159827213822894,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.6176470588235294,0.9523809523809523,0.07103722834188365,0.0
"A predictive model or forecast that can be used to trigger pre-agreed action plans and pre-arranged finance is at the heart of anticipatory action. Ideally, all these elements can be captured in a single framework document that serves as a ‘rulebook’ for how anticipatory action is supposed to work for a specific shock, in a specific context. But what happens when there is insufficient forecast data available, or the complex operating environment in the country requires more time to prepare and respond?

"Surgery Cosmetic surgery is covered only when prior approved for medical necessity. Examples of medical necessity include prompt repair of accidental injuries or improvement of the functioning of a malformed body member. Elective surgery is covered when medically necessary. Multiple surgeries are governed by the following rules: When multiple or bilateral surgical procedures that add significant time or complexity are performed at the same operative session, Medicaid pays for the procedure with the highest allowed amount and half of the allowed amount for each subsequent procedure. This also applies to laser surgical procedures. Additional payments will not be made for procedures considered to be mutually exclusive or incidental. When multiple and/or bilateral procedures are billed in conjunction with one another that meet the definition of bundled, subset, CPT’s “Format of Terminology”, and/or comprehensive/component (bundled) codes, then, the procedure with the highest allowed amount will be paid while the lesser procedure will not be considered for payment as the procedure is considered an integral part of the covered service.. Any dressing/compression wrap performed in conjunction with wound debridement is considered part of the debridement services and is not separately covered/billable. Certain procedures are commonly carried out as integral parts of a total service and as such do not warrant a separate charge. When incidental procedures (e.g., excision of a previous scar or puncture of an ovarian cyst) are performed during the same operative session, Medicaid reimburses for the major procedure only. Laparotomy is covered when it is the only surgical procedure performed during the operative session or when performed with an unrelated or incidental surgical procedure. Surgeons performing laparoscopic procedures on recipients where a laparoscopic procedure code (PC) has not been established should bill the most descriptive PC with modifier 22 (unusual procedural services) until the new PC is established. CPT defined Add-on codes are considered for coverage when billed with the appropriate primary procedure code. Effective January 1, 2005, code 69990 (operating microscope) may be paid separately only when submitted with the following CPT codes: 61304-61546, 61550-61711, 62010-62100, 63081- 63308, 63704-63710, 64831, 64834-64836, 64840-64858, 64861- 64870, 64885-64898, 64905-64907. Certain relatively small surgical procedure codes formally designated in the CPT with an (*) may be billed in addition to an office visit. Additionally, these codes do not carry the global surgical package concept of inclusion of post-operative care within 62 days of the surgery. In the 2004 CPT guidelines the (*) designation has been removed. For reference, these codes are listed the Procedure Codes section in Chapter 28 of the Billing Manual. It is necessary to append the appropriate anatomical modifiers to surgical codes to differentiate between multiple surgeries and sites. Appropriate use of CPT and HCPCs modifiers is required to differentiate between sites and procedures.

"Modifier 59 (Distinct Procedural Service) According to the CPT book, modifier 59 is described as being necessary to describe a distinct procedural service. This modifier should only be used to show a distinct procedural service when a comprehensive/component coding pair is billed. Modifier 59 should not be billed to represent that multiple services of the same procedure code were performed. A comprehensive/coding pair occurs when one code is considered a component procedure and the other code is considered a comprehensive procedure. These code pairs are frequently referred to as bundled codes thus meaning the component code is usually considered an integral part of the comprehensive code. Therefore, in most instances the most comprehensive code only should be billed and the component code should be denied as rebundled or mutually exclusive. Modifier 59 should only be used in conjunction with a comprehensive/coding pair procedure when appropriately unbundling the code pair. This modifier 59 should not be billed with the comprehensive code. The component code can be unbundled, or allowed separately, in certain situations. If the two services are performed at two different times of day or the services are performed in two different anatomical sites, then modifier 59 can be submitted with the component procedure code. In order to communicate the special circumstances of the component/comprehensive code pair unbundling, diagnoses codes and anatomical modifiers must be utilized as appropriate on the claim form. In some cases, it may be necessary to attach a copy of the Operative Report to further explain the reason for the unbundling of code pairs. Modifier 59 should never be used in any other circumstances and is subject to post payment review. If the services performed and billed for a date of service does not include a coding pair described above, then modifier 59 is not valid or appropriate.",Paragraph,29.0,29.0,10.020000457763672,10.020000457763672,0,0,414.0,0.782608695652174,10.020000457763672,28.0,9.000000238418579,18.0,302.0,1922.0,5.367549668874172,308.99212646484375,171.00001525878906,335.4981231689453,379.16064453125,0,0,1.014829581627453,0,0.0,0.011966701352757543,0.008324661810613945,0.014568158168574402,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,1,0.5298013245033113,0.61875,0.7942144551867024,0.0

"Modifier 76 (Repeat Procedure) Prior to January 1, 2004, providers were advised to file multiple services with modifiers Y2-Y9 and Z2-Z3 to avoid services being denied as duplicates. Since these modifiers have been eliminated, we are revising instructions for filing multiple services that are performed on the same day. . The appropriate use of CPT and HCPCS codes is required when filing claims. In addition, diagnosis codes and modifiers should assist with accurately describing services billed. It is necessary to append the appropriate anatomical modifiers to procedure codes to differentiate between multiple sites. If a claim drops for manual review, the appropriate use of diagnosis codes and modifiers may assist claim reviewers in determining the intent of billing without having to request documentation. As always, providers can continue to file modifiers RT and LT when two of the same procedure is performed and one is on the right side and one is on the left side of the body. However, if more than one service is performed on the right or left side, services could be denied as duplicates if more than one RT or LT modifier is filed on the same procedure code. Modifier 76 is defined by the CPT as “Repeat Procedure by Same Physician”. Therefore, we are providing the following instructions to educate providers on how to submit those services. 1) If multiple services are performed, anatomical modifiers can be filed in addition to modifier 76 on the second line item. Anatomical modifiers are: LT, RT, E1-E4, F1-F9, FA, T1-T9, and TA. Date of Service Place Procedure Number of Services 2/4/03-2/4/03 11 73580-RT 1 2/4/03-2/4/03 11 73580-RT76 1 2) If multiple services are performed, anatomical modifiers can be used without modifier 76. Date of Service Place Procedure Number of Services 2/4/04-2/4/03 11 28820-T8 1 2/4/03-2/4/03 11 28820-TA 1 Multiple services (excluding most surgeries) can also be filed with multiple units of service. Modifier 76 is defined as “repeat procedure by same physician”. The Agency requires claims filed with multiple units of service be submitted as shown below. 3) The first line must be submitted with only one unit of service and the second line with modifier 76 can show the additional number of services that were performed that day.

"Despite the pipeline analyses and Section 1311 reviews, six commitments totalling $2,064,406 should have been decommitted as of September 30, 1996 (see Appendix III). One commitment was for $2.0 million and represented 99 percent of the total recommended for decommitment. The reasons these commitments were not decommitted varied. For example, the Mission did not decommit the balances at September 30, 1996 because financial management personnel anticipated a commitment document extension that never occurred or they anticipated additional payments needed to be processed. In general more vigorous application of existing analyses and monitoring procedures, and more persistent follow-up on unliquidated balances would result in more prompt decommitment actions.

"The American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut population has grown rapidly since 1970. In the last two decades, the American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut population grew rapidly. In 1970, this population num- bered 827,000; it reached 1.4 million in 1980 and nearly 2 million in 1990. The 1990 census counted 1,878,285 American Indians, 57,152 Eskimos, and 23,797 Aleuts. Census Bureau estimates and projections suggest that on July 1, 1994, the American In- dian, Eskimo, and Aleut popu- lation numbered 2.2 million, and that it will reach 4.3 million and just over 1 percent of the population by 2050. The 72 percent increase between the 1970 and 1980 censuses and the 38 percent increase between the 1980 and 1990 censuses cannot be attributed only to natural increase. Other factors that may have contributed to the higher count of American In- dians 1 include improvements in the question on race; improvements in the way the Census Bureau counted",H1,0.0,35.0,8.98285714104062,9.0,1,0,5.0,0.07936507936507936,9.0,373.0,9.0,40.0,155.0,942.0,5.083870967741936,116.79499053955078,183.1179962158203,117.65702819824219,351.2880172729492,1,0,1.0448365820286676,0,2.0,0.03078556263269639,0.08598726114649681,0.03503184713375796,0,0,2.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.6129032258064516,0.7157894736842105,0.08292353825624345,1.8412698412698414

"Insufficient Data Insufficient data refers to the gaps in impact data used to verify the forecast predictions. Insufficient data might limit the precise prediction of forecasted humanitarian impact and expose local populations to adverse humanitarian impact induced by a drought event, requiring a large-scale humanitarian response ex-post.

"False Positives A false positive happens when drought impact is predicted but no drought conditions occur. Anticipatory action follows the ‘no regret’ principle, but a false alarm can still lead to inadequate resource allocation with a high potential impact on affected communities.

Lack of Trust and Ownership Lack of trust and ownership refers to the limited involvement of local and regional authorities in the model design and validation. This may lead to little ownership and trust put into the model and eventually to political blockages in activations.

Lack of Transparency Lack of transparency refers to the algorithms not being made available or not being transparent. The anticipatory action framework should reflect clearer strategies to engage with local leaders to better understand what is happening on the ground and obtain early buy-in. Mitigation strategy for a potential lack of transparency should be expanded in the model card and/or the anticipatory action framework.,H3,3.0,6.0,11.166666666666666,12.0,0,0,22.0,0.88,11.0,123.0,11.05,691.0,64.0,428.0,5.703125,117.81689453125,72.0,467.86090087890625,90.16064453125,1,1,0.8583581018755764,0,0.0,0.011682242990654205,0.0,0.011682242990654205,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,1,1,0.578125,0.8378378378378378,0.7553551296505072,0.0
"Inaction Inaction refers to the situation in which drought impact is predicted but no action is taken. Inaction in case of trigger activation is unlikely, given the pre-allocated financing attached to it and the UN-validated anticipatory action framework. Inaction might nevertheless be a possibility, if government or local authorities block the roll-out of interventions on the ground or in case of conflict upsurge. The team could consider adding a consensus-based decision-making option around activation or non-activation in the event of specific events or situational context not considered in the model design (e.g., higher levels of vulnerability or increase in armed conflict, etc.)",H3,3.0,20.0,11.05,12.0,0,0,23.0,0.92,11.166666666666666,428.0,11.25,234.0,102.0,691.0,5.784313725490196,225.474365234375,72.0,467.984619140625,135.708251953125,0,1,0.8493901814082198,0,0.0,0.010130246020260492,0.0,0.02604920405209841,0,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.6078431372549019,0.9032258064516129,0.7814389668955622,0.0

"- Data availability: A core aspect to consider is whether sufficient data are available to support validation and estimation of a model. Data availability (especially historical data) is often a challenge in countries with humanitarian operations. The lack of data can jeopardize the possibility to build reliable predictive tools 2 ’ 3 . Nevertheless, developing the conceptual component of a model may bring value by fostering trust and synergy between stakeholders, even when quantitative model estimation is not possible. Imperfect proxies or imputed data may also be sufficient in contexts when the focus is not on maximizing the accuracy of pointwise prediction of a certain variable at each time point (e.g., daily numbers of cases in an epidemic), but on projecting holistic scenarios and trends (e.g., when and whether the number of cases is expected to rise significantly). - Synergy with domain experts and actors in the field: Receiving an explicit endorsement and establishing strong partnerships with domain experts and actors in the field is another key condition for model development to be viable.

"- Complexity of the problem space: It is essential to consider whether the target problem space displays complex systems characteristics, which can only be captured through dynamic and causal modeling strategies, or whether traditional non-dynamic and non-causal predictive models may yield comparable insights. Preliminary data analyses may help clarify this point. This is a general criterion that applies to complex systems modeling beyond humanitarian settings. - Ability to inform response activities: Complex systems models can be used to simply test hypotheses on the structure of causal drivers of a crisis, but their impact on humanitarian response may be significantly larger if they can directly provide decision makers with a tool to test and evaluate the potential consequences of different types of response activities.

"Network/graph models : Components of the systems are represented as nodes in a network, and their relations (i.e., whether and how each node interacts with each other) are defined by edges connecting each node (which may include loops, i.e., edges that connect nodes with themselves). Complex networks are a specific class of networks which display special topological features. Small-world networks, for example, are networks where nodes tend to be grouped in tight clusters, but a few long-range connections between nodes make clusters communicate with each other. This is an example of a class of complex networks that is often found in real-world phenomena. In human social networks, for example, small-world properties motivate hypotheses postulating that all people are on average a few social connections away from each other (e.g., the six degrees of separation hypothesis). In addition to the complexity of the network structure itself, these models are also able to capture the evolution of dynamic processes in connected complex networks (e.g., an epidemic spreading in a society).",Paragraph,9.0,12.0,10.0,10.0,1,0,73.0,0.4965986394557823,10.0,409.0,10.0,1042.0,168.0,1092.0,5.505952380952381,391.251953125,77.25,438.7808837890625,156.634765625,0,1,0.9077694119075925,0,2.0,0.00641025641025641,0.0,0.03663003663003663,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0.5773809523809523,0.8041237113402062,0.4507970548928861,0.0

Agent-based models are a microscale modeling technique: the level of description is that of the individual agents, and the macroscale behavior of the system emerges (over the course of a computer simulation) as a function of the cumulative effects of agents’ behaviors and their interactions over time. Agent-based models are often used to predict the dynamics of epidemic diseases as a function of assumptions on how individuals behave (e.g., the average number and duration of social contacts) and on epidemiological parameters (e.g., incubation time, recovery rate).

"Step 1: Problem identification and system conceptualization The problem should be narrowed down to a few concrete goals and outputs. Stakeholders should define which variables the model should predict, and what these predictions will be concretely used for. For example, if the target problem is modeling the unfolding of an epidemic, interviews with stakeholders and experts should be conducted to define whether the model should simply help to monitor the number of cases (e.g., to increase preparedness of the healthcare system) or rather understand how to intervene in order to minimize the number of deaths.",H2,10.0,8.0,11.0,11.0,1,0,82.0,0.5578231292517006,10.633333365122477,268.0,7.4666666984558105,290.0,95.0,612.0,5.4526315789473685,601.61083984375,72.0,439.33599853515625,114.1123046875,0,1,0.9985463530983518,0,2.0,0.008169934640522876,0.0016339869281045752,0.0196078431372549,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0,1,1,0.5157894736842106,0.8775510204081632,0.5570122513881962,0.0

"Adjudication of water rights through the state courts should be completed to fully define and quantify all state, tribal and federal water rights. Discussion: The purpose of a general stream adjudication is to provide certainty and predictability in the administration and distribution of water diverting from hydraulically connected water sources. The need for a general adjudication of water rights in the Snake River Basin became apparent as the spring flows in the Thousand Springs reach began to decline and disputes arose over the availability of water supplies on the Snake River Plain. As part of the 1984 Swan Falls Agreement, the State agreed to commence the Snake River Basin Adjudication, the largest legal proceeding in the history of the state. The SRBA is the cornerstone for the long-term management of the Snake River Basin within Idaho. At the conclusion of the SRBA, the state will have a listing of all water rights within the basin, which is the predicate for establishing water districts to administer all water rights in accordance with the prior appropriation doctrine, as established by law. Pursuant to Idaho Code § 42-1734(3), the IWRB is authorized to represent the state, when requested to do so by the Governor, in proceedings, negotiations, and hearings involving the federal government. In the SRBA, the IWRB coordinated state participation in the negotiation of federal reserved water rights, including tribal claims. The IWRB successfully negotiated agreements resolving federal reserved right claims including those filed by the Shoshone-Bannock, Nez Perce, and Shoshone-Paiute tribes as well as the claims of numerous federal agencies. The final settlement of the Nez Perce Tribe’s claims reflected the tribe’s and the state’s shared interest in addressing environmental concerns and addressed the conflicting demands for consumptive and nonconsumptive uses. Consistent with state law, Tt he IWRB should serve as the lead agency for coordinating state participation in all general stream adjudications. On November 12, 2008, the district court ordered the commencement of an adjudication in the Coeur d’Alene Spokane River water system. Like the SRBA, the determination of all existing water rights from the water basins in Northern Idaho will provide the basis for administration of water rights in accordance with the prior appropriation doctrine, as established by law.",H1,0.0,27.0,12.0,12.0,1,0,1.0,0.5,12.0,30.0,12.0,0.0,370.0,2408.0,5.510810810810811,86.32801818847656,67.67996215820312,493.0794372558594,555.6359710693359,1,1,1.0,0,2.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0070598006644518275,0.018687707641196014,1,0,0.0,0.0,0,1,0,0,0.5945945945945946,0.7,0.5,0.0
