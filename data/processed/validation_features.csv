"ANNOUNCEMENT AND REPORT   CONCERNING   ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENTS      March 31, 2003       This Announcement is issued pursuant to § 521(b) of Pub. L. 106-170, the Ticket to Work and  Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, requiring that the Secretary of the Treasury annually  report to the public concerning Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) and the APA Program.   The first report covered calendar years 1991 through 1999.  Subsequent reports covered calendar  years 2000 and 2001.  This fourth report describes the experience of the APA Program during  calendar year 2002 consistent with the mandate of § 521(b).  This document does not provide  guidance regarding the application of the arm’s length standard; rather, it reports on the structure  and activities of the APA program.      Mindy Piatoff  Acting Director, Advance Pricing Agreement Program        Background    Internal Revenue Code (IRC) § 482 provides that the Secretary may distribute, apportion, or  allocate gross income, deductions, credits, or allowances between or among two or more  commonly controlled businesses if necessary to reflect clearly the income of such businesses.   Under the regulations, the standard to be applied in determining the true taxable income of a  controlled business is that of a business dealing at arm’s length with an unrelated business. The  arm’s length standard also has been adopted by the international community and is incorporated  into the transfer pricing guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD).  OECD, TRANSFER PRICING GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL  ENTERPRISES AND TAX ADMINISTRATORS (1995).  Transfer pricing issues by their nature are  highly factual and have traditionally been one of the largest issues identified by the IRS in its  audits of multinational corporations.  The APA Program is designed to resolve actual or potential  transfer pricing disputes in a principled, cooperative manner, as an alternative to the traditional  examination process.  An APA is a binding contract between the IRS and a taxpayer by which  the IRS agrees not to seek a transfer pricing adjustment under IRC § 482 for a covered  transaction if the taxpayer files its tax return for a covered year consistent with the agreed  transfer pricing method (TPM).  In year 2002, the IRS and taxpayers executed 85 APAs and  amended 9 APAs.    Since 1991, with the issuance of Rev. Proc. 91-22, 1991-1 C.B. 526, the IRS has offered  taxpayers through the APA Program the opportunity to reach an agreement in advance of filing a",1,"(72.0000228881836, 72.1620101928711, 541.735595703125, 712.3917846679688)",12.0,TimesNewRoman,4,792.0,612.0,0,114,0.0,0.08421052966201437,0.956140350877193,False,True,0.0,True,False,0.09111364923342309,0.0,0,0,0.0,3458,1,1.815617729622507,False,False,True,11,6,2.5,0.5,11.0,Title,0.55,469.7355728149414,640.2297744750977,0.7336984181969066,18,21.666666666666668,390,5.425641025641026,0.5974358974358974,2573,0.7691410804508356,0.029148853478429847,0.014768752429071124,0.17761368052856588,0.336322869955157,0.8539325842696629,False,False,False,14,0,0.0,1,1.0,Title,Paragraph,7AUNHNHEJ5WZYXSDOPHTM3UHLGVPSSX6.pdf
"tax return on the appropriate TPM to be applied to related party transactions.  In 1996, the IRS  issued internal procedures for processing APA requests.  Chief Counsel Directives Manual  (CCDM), ¶¶ 42.10.10 – 42.10.16 (November 15, 1996).  Also in 1996, the IRS updated Rev.  Proc. 91-22 with the release of Rev. Proc. 96-53, 1996-2 C.B. 375.  The APA Program continues  to operate under the provisions of Rev. Proc. 96-53, which provides taxpayers with instructions  of how to apply for an APA, and what to expect in the processing of the case.  In addition, in  1998, the IRS published Notice 98-65, 1998-2 C.B. 803, which set forth streamlined APA  procedures for Small Business Taxpayers (SBTs).  That Notice also expanded the availability of  the lowest APA user fee in an effort to attract taxpayers who may not have the resources to do  the sophisticated economic studies normally required in APA submissions.     Advance Pricing Agreements    An APA generally combines an agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS on an appropriate  TPM for the transactions at issue (Covered Transactions) with an agreement between the U.S.  and one or more foreign tax authorities (under the authority of the mutual agreement process of  our income tax treaties) that the TPM is correct. With such a “bilateral” APA, the taxpayer  ordinarily is assured that the income associated with the Covered Transactions will not be subject  to double taxation by the IRS and the foreign tax authority.  It is the policy of the United States,  as reflected in § 7 of Rev. Proc. 96-53 to encourage taxpayers that enter the APA program to  seek bilateral or multilateral APAs when competent authority procedures are available with  respect to the foreign country or countries involved.  However, the IRS may execute an APA  with a taxpayer without reaching a competent authority agreement (a “unilateral” APA).    A unilateral APA is an agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS establishing an approved TPM  for U.S. tax purposes.  A unilateral APA binds the taxpayer and the IRS, but obviously does not  prevent foreign tax administrations from taking different positions on the appropriate TPM for a  transaction.  As stated in Rev. Proc. 96-53, should a transaction covered by a unilateral APA be  subject to double taxation as the result of an adjustment by a foreign tax administration, the  taxpayer may seek relief by requesting that the U.S. Competent Authority consider initiating a  mutual agreement proceeding, provided there is an applicable income tax treaty in force with the  other country.    When a unilateral APA involves taxpayers operating in a country that is a treaty partner,  information relevant to the APA (including a copy of the APA and APA annual reports) may be  provided to the treaty partner under normal rules and principles governing the exchange of  information under income tax treaties.    The APA Program    APAs are negotiated with the taxpayer by an IRS team headed by an APA team leader.  As of  December 31, 2002, the APA program had 17 team leaders.  The team leader is responsible for  organizing the IRS APA team.  The IRS APA team arranges meetings with the taxpayer, secures  whatever information is necessary from the taxpayer to analyze the taxpayer’s related party  transactions and the available facts under the arm’s length standard of IRC § 482 and the  regulations thereunder (Treas. Reg.), and negotiates with the taxpayer.",2,"(72.0, 71.50801086425781, 541.800048828125, 710.5916748046875)",12.0,TimesNewRoman,4,792.0,612.0,1,114,0.008771929824561403,0.08421052966201437,0.956140350877193,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.09028789250537603,0.0,2573,1,0.0,3223,1,2.6907803985328385,False,False,True,8,2,1.5,0.5,8.0,Title,0.6666666666666666,469.800048828125,639.0836639404297,0.7351150957786272,34,16.323529411764707,554,5.126353790613718,0.48014440433212996,3458,0.7677848467322151,0.02371312897628687,0.019664545980335454,0.178716020821284,0.35545023696682465,0.7816455696202531,False,True,False,16,0,0.0,3,0.9824561403508771,Title,Paragraph,7AUNHNHEJ5WZYXSDOPHTM3UHLGVPSSX6.pdf
"The APA team generally includes an economist, an international examiner, LMSB field counsel,  and, in a bilateral case, a U.S. Competent Authority analyst who leads the discussions with the  treaty partner. The economist may be from the APA Program or the IRS field organization.  As  of December 31, 2002, the APA Program had 7 economists.  The APA team may also include an  LMSB International Technical Advisor, other LMSB exam personnel, and an Appeals officer.      The APA Process    The APA process is voluntary.  Taxpayers submit an application for an APA, together with a  user fee as set forth in Rev. Proc. 96-53.  The APA process can be broken into five phases:  (1)  application; (2) due diligence; (3) analysis; (4) discussion and agreement; and (5) drafting,  review, and execution.    (1)  Application    In many APA cases, the taxpayer’s application is preceded by a pre-file conference with the APA  staff in which the taxpayer can solicit the informal views of the APA Program.  Pre-file  conferences can occur on an anonymous basis, although a taxpayer must disclose its identity  when it applies for an APA.  Taxpayers must file the appropriate user fee on or before the due  date of the tax return for the first taxable year that the taxpayer proposes to be covered by the  APA.  Many taxpayers file a user fee first and then follow up with a full application later.  The  procedures for pre-file conferences, user fees, and delayed applications can be found in Rev.  Proc. 96-53.    The APA application can be a relatively modest document for a small business taxpayer.  Notice  98-65 describes the special APA procedures for small businesses.  For most taxpayers, however,  the APA application is a substantial document filling several binders. The APA Program makes  every effort to reach agreement on the basis of the information provided in the taxpayer's  application.     The application is assigned to an APA team leader who is responsible for the case.  The APA  team leader’s first responsibility is to organize the APA team.  This involves contacting the  appropriate LMSB International Territory Manager to secure the assignment of an international  examiner to the APA case and the LMSB Counsel’s office to secure a field counsel lawyer.   In a  bilateral case, the U.S. Competent Authority will assign a U.S. Competent Authority analyst to  the team.   In a large APA case, the international examiner may invite his or her manager and  other LMSB personnel familiar with the taxpayer to join the team.  When the APA may affect  taxable years in Appeals, the appropriate appellate conferee will be invited to join the team.  In  all cases, the team leader contacts the Manager, LMSB International Technical Advisors, to  determine whether to include a technical advisor on the team.  The IRS APA team will generally  include a technical advisor if the APA request concerns cost-sharing, intangibles or services. The  APA team leader then distributes copies of the APA application to all team members and sets up  an opening conference with the taxpayer.  The APA office strives to hold this opening  conference within 45 days of the assignment of the case to a team leader.  At the opening",3,"(71.99993896484375, 71.50801086425781, 542.27978515625, 708.1918334960938)",12.0,TimesNewRoman,4,792.0,612.0,2,114,0.017543859649122806,0.08421052966201437,0.956140350877193,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.09028789250537603,0.0,3458,1,0.0,3420,1,2.4583925711950667,False,False,True,8,4,2.5,0.5,8.0,Title,0.5333333333333333,470.27984619140625,636.6838226318359,0.7386395404981835,34,15.235294117647058,518,5.079150579150579,0.4691119691119691,3223,0.7803288861309339,0.008377288240769469,0.020477815699658702,0.1836798014272417,0.3445378151260504,0.7508417508417509,False,False,True,12,1,0.0,4,0.9736842105263158,Title,Paragraph,7AUNHNHEJ5WZYXSDOPHTM3UHLGVPSSX6.pdf
"conference, the APA team leader proposes a case plan designed to complete the recommended  U.S. negotiating position for a bilateral APA within 9 months from the date the full application  was filed and to complete a unilateral APA within 12 months from the application date.  In 2002,  the median for completing negotiating positions was 12.0 months (average 13.7), and the median  for completing unilateral APAs was 15.9 months (average 20.2).    (2)  Due Diligence    The APA team must satisfy itself that the relevant facts submitted by the taxpayer are complete  and accurate.  This due diligence aspect of the APA is vital to the process.  It is because of this  due diligence that the IRS can reach advance agreements with taxpayers in the highly factual  setting of transfer pricing.  Due diligence can proceed in a number of ways.  Typically, the  taxpayer and the APA team will agree to dates for future meetings during the opening  conference. In advance of the opening conference, the APA team leader will submit a list of  questions to the taxpayer for discussion. The opening conference may result in a second set of  questions.  These questions are developed by the APA team and provided to the taxpayer through  the APA team leader.  It is important to note that this due diligence is not an audit and is focused  on the transfer pricing issues associated with the transactions in the taxpayer’s application, or  such other transactions that the taxpayer and the IRS may agree to add.    (3)   Analysis     A significant part of the analytical work associated with an APA is done typically by the APA or  IRS field economist assigned to the case.  The analysis may result in the need for additional  information.  Once the IRS APA team has completed its due diligence and analysis, it begins  negotiations with the taxpayer over the various aspects of the APA including the selection of  comparable transactions, asset intensity and other adjustments, the TPM, which transactions to  cover, the appropriate critical assumptions, the APA term, and other key issues.  The APA team  leader will discuss particularly difficult issues with his or her managers, but generally the APA  team leader is empowered to negotiate the APA.    (4)   Discussion and Agreement    This phase differs for bilateral and unilateral cases.  In a bilateral case, the discussions proceed in  two parts and involve two IRS offices -- the APA Program and the U.S. Competent Authority.   In the first part, the APA team will attempt to reach a consensus with the taxpayer regarding the  recommended position that the U.S. Competent Authority should take in negotiations with its  treaty partner.  This recommended U.S. negotiating position is a paper drafted by the APA team  leader and signed by the APA Director that provides the APA Program’s view of the best TPM  for the covered transaction, taking into account IRC § 482 and the regulations thereunder, the  relevant tax treaty, and the U.S. Competent Authority’s experience with the treaty partner.    The experience of the APA office and the U.S. Competent Authority is that APA negotiations  are likely to proceed more rapidly with a foreign competent authority if the taxpayer fully  supports the U.S. negotiating position.  Consequently, the APA Office works together with the  taxpayer in developing the recommended U.S. negotiating position.  On occasion, the APA team",4,"(71.99990844726562, 71.50801086425781, 541.7979736328125, 705.7919921875)",12.0,TimesNewRoman,4,792.0,612.0,3,114,0.02631578947368421,0.08421052966201437,0.956140350877193,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.09028789250537603,0.0,3223,1,0.0,2936,1,2.6532027924101347,False,False,True,8,5,3.0,0.5,8.0,Title,0.48484848484848486,469.7980651855469,634.2839813232422,0.7406746489253204,26,21.0,546,5.131868131868132,0.4523809523809524,3420,0.7891812865497077,0.007309941520467836,0.018128654970760234,0.18070175438596492,0.3824503311258278,0.7263681592039801,False,False,False,10,0,0.0,5,0.9649122807017544,Title,Paragraph,7AUNHNHEJ5WZYXSDOPHTM3UHLGVPSSX6.pdf
"will agree to disagree with a taxpayer.  In these cases, the APA office will send a recommended  U.S. negotiating position to the U.S. Competent Authority that includes elements with which the  taxpayer does not agree.  This disagreement is noted in the paper.  The APA team leader also  solicits the views of the field members of the APA team, and, in the vast majority of APA cases,  the international examiner, LMSB field counsel, and other IRS field team members concur in the  position prepared by the APA team leader.    Once the APA Program completes the recommended U.S. negotiating position, the APA process  shifts from the APA Program to the U.S. Competent Authority.  The U.S. Competent Authority  analyst assigned to the APA takes the recommended U.S. negotiating position and prepares the  final U.S. negotiating position, which is then transmitted to the foreign competent authority.  The  negotiations with the foreign competent authority are conducted by the U.S. Competent  Authority analyst, most often in face-to-face negotiating sessions conducted periodically  throughout the year.  At the request of the U.S. Competent Authority analyst, the APA team  leader may continue to assist the negotiations.    In unilateral APA cases, the discussions proceed solely between the APA Program and the  taxpayer.  In a unilateral case, the taxpayer and the APA Program must reach agreement to  conclude an APA.  Like the bilateral cases, the APA team leader almost always will achieve a  consensus with the IRS field personnel assigned to the APA team regarding the final APA.  The  APA Program has a procedure in which the IRS field personnel are solicited formally for their  concurrence in the final APA.  This concurrence, or any items in disagreement, is noted in a  cover memorandum prepared by the APA team leader that accompanies the final APA sent  forward for review and execution.    (5)  Drafting, Review, and Execution    Once the IRS and the taxpayer reach agreement, the drafting of the final APA generally takes  little time because the APA Program has developed standard language that is incorporated into  every APA.  The current version of this language is found in Attachment A.  APAs are reviewed  by the Branch Chief and the APA Director.  In addition, the team leader prepares a summary  memorandum for the Associate Chief Counsel (International) (ACC(I)).  On March 1, 2001, the  ACC(I) delegated to the APA Director the authority to execute APAs on behalf of the IRS.  See  Chief Counsel Notice CC-2001-016.  The APA is executed for the taxpayer by an appropriate  corporate officer.    Model APA at Attachment A  [§ 521(b)(2)(B)]    Attachment A contains the current version of the model APA language.

In six of  these, the taxpayer reorganized its business.  In three, the changes reflected technical corrections or modifications to  minor aspects of the APA.  4 In the history of the APA Program, five APAs have been canceled and no APAs have been revoked.    5 Reasons for withdrawals included jurisdictional issues, inventory corrections, taxpayer reorganizations, and  changes in facts and circumstances.",7,"(72.0, 604.7117919921875, 539.8502197265625, 719.8031616210938)",10.199999809265137,TimesNewRoman,4,792.0,612.0,24,114,0.21052631578947367,-1.715789661072849,0.07894736842105263,False,False,1.8000001907348633,False,False,0.7635249898891256,-1.8000001907348633,32,0,1.8000001907348633,618,1,0.03167032316574106,False,True,False,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Title,0.0,467.8502197265625,115.09136962890625,4.065033036230873,7,16.0,112,5.758928571428571,0.7410714285714286,769,0.7997399219765929,0.018205461638491547,0.018205461638491547,0.16124837451235371,0.3046875,0.9212598425196851,True,True,False,2,0,0.0,109,0.05263157894736842,Paragraph,Paragraph,7AUNHNHEJ5WZYXSDOPHTM3UHLGVPSSX6.pdf

"Discussion    The vast majority of APAs have covered transactions that involve numerous business functions  and risks. For instance, with respect to functions, companies that manufacture products have  typically conducted research and development, engaged in product design and engineering,  manufactured the product, marketed and distributed the product, and performed support  functions such as legal, finance, and human resources services. Regarding risks, companies have  been subject to market risks, R&D risks, financial risks, credit and collection risks, product  liability risks, and general business risks. In the APA evaluation process a significant amount of  time and effort is devoted to understanding how the functions and risks are allocated amongst the  controlled group of companies that are party to the covered transactions.    In its APA submission, the taxpayer must provide a functional analysis. The functional analysis  identifies the economic activities performed, the assets employed, the economic costs incurred,  and the risks assumed by each of the controlled parties. The importance of the functional analysis  derives from the fact that economic theory posits that there is a positive relationship between risk  and expected return and that different functions provide different value and have different  opportunity costs associated with them. It is important that the functional analysis go beyond  simply categorizing the tested party as, say, a distributor. It should provide more specific  information since, in the example of distributors, not all distributors undertake similar functions  and risks.    Thus, the functional analysis is critical in determining the TPM (including the selection of  comparables). Although functional comparability is an essential factor in evaluating the  reliability of the TPM (including the selection of comparables), the APA evaluation process also  involves consideration of economic conditions such as the economic condition of the particular  industry.    In evaluating the functional analysis, the APA program considers contractual terms between the  controlled parties and the consistency of the conduct of the parties with respect to the allocation  of risk. In accord with the section 482 regulations, the APA program also gives consideration to  the ability of controlled parties to fund losses that might be expected to occur as the result of the  assumption of risk. Another relevant factor considered in evaluating the functional analysis is the  extent to which each controlled party exercises managerial or operational control over the  business activities that directly influence the amount of income or loss realized. The section 482  regulations posit that parties at arm's length will ordinarily bear a greater share of those risks  over which they have relatively more control.

Under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-3, the arm’s length amount for controlled transfers of tangible  property may be determined using the Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method, the Resale  Price Method, the Cost Plus Method, the Comparable Profits Method (CPM), or the Profit Split  method.  Under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-4, the arm’s length amount for controlled transfers of  intangible property may be determined using the Comparable Uncontrolled Transaction (CUT)  method, CPM, or the Profit Split Method.  An “Unspecified Method” may be used for both  tangible and intangible property if it provides a more reliable result than the enumerated methods  under the best method rule of Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(c).  For transfers involving the provision of  services, Treas. Reg. § 1.482-2(b) provides that services performed for the benefit of another  member of a controlled group should bear an arm’s length charge, either deemed to be equal to  the cost of providing the services (when non-integral) or which should be an amount that would  have been charged between independent parties.      In addition, Treas. Reg. § 1.482-2(a) provides rules concerning the proper treatment of loans or  advances, and Treas. Reg. § 1.482-7 provides rules for qualified cost sharing arrangements under  which the parties agree to share the costs of development of intangibles in proportion to their  shares of reasonably anticipated benefits.  APAs involving cost sharing arrangements generally  address both the method of allocating costs among the parties as well as determining the  appropriate amount of the “buy-in” payment due for the transfer of intangibles to the controlled  participants.      In reviewing the TPMs applicable to transfers of tangible and intangible property reflected in  Table 16, the majority of the APAs followed the specified methods.  However, there are several  distinguishing points that should be made.  The Regulations note that for transfers of tangible  property, the Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method will generally be the most direct  and reliable measure of an arm’s length price for the controlled transaction if sufficiently reliable  comparable transactions can be identified.  Treas. Reg. § 1.482-3(b)(2)(ii)(A).  It was the  experience of the APA Program in Year 2002 that in the cases that come into the APA Program,  sufficiently reliable CUP transactions are difficult to find.

"Similar to the CUP method, for transfers of intangible property, the CUT method will generally  provide the most reliable measure of an arm’s length result if sufficiently reliable comparables  may be found.  Treas. Reg. § 1.482-4(c)(2)(ii).  It has generally been difficult to identify external  comparables, and APAs using the CUT method tend to rely on internal transactions between the  taxpayer and unrelated parties.  In Year 2002, there were eight covered transactions that utilized  the CUT TPM.      The Cost Plus Method (tangibles only) and Resale Price Method were applied in Year 2002 in  five and eight APAs respectively.  See Treas. Reg. § 1.482-3(c), (d).      The CPM is frequently applied in APAs.  This is because reliable public data on comparable  business activities of independent companies may be more readily available than potential CUP  data, and comparability of resources employed, functions, risks, and other relevant  considerations is more likely to exist than comparability of product.  The CPM also tends to be  less sensitive than other methods to differences in accounting practices between the tested party  and comparable companies, e.g., classification of expenses as cost of goods sold or operating  expenses.  Treas. Reg. § 1.482-3(c)(3)(iii)(B), and -3(d)(3)(iii)(B).  In addition, the degree of  functional comparability required to obtain a reliable result under the CPM is generally less than  required under the Resale Price or Cost Plus methods, because differences in functions  performed often are reflected in operating expenses, and thus taxpayers performing different  functions may have very different gross profit margins but earn similar levels of operating profit.   Treas. Reg. § 1.482-5(c)(2).    Table 16 reflects 35 uses of the CPM (with varying PLIs) in covered transactions involving  tangible or intangible property.  The CPM was also used in some APAs concurrently with other  methods.      The CPM has proven to be versatile in part because of the various PLIs that can be used in  connection with the method.  Reaching agreement on the appropriate PLI has been the subject of  much discussion in many of the cases, and it depends heavily on the facts and circumstances.   Some APAs have called for different PLIs to apply to different parts of the covered transactions  or with one PLI used as a check against the primary PLI.      The CPM also was used regularly with services as the covered transactions in APAs executed in  Year 2002.  There were a total of fifteen services covered transactions using the CPM method  with various PLIs according to the specific facts of the taxpayers involved.  Table 17 reflects the  methods used to determine the arm’s length results for APAs involving services transactions.      In Year 2002, there were fourteen APAs involving tangible or intangible property that used the  residual profit split, Treas. Reg. § 1.482-6(c)(3).  In residual profit split cases, routine  contributions by the controlled parties are allocated routine market returns, and the residual  income is allocated among the controlled taxpayers based upon the relative value of their  contributions of intangible property to the relevant business activity.",16,"(71.99996948242188, 71.50801086425781, 543.00048828125, 664.3916625976562)",12.0,TimesNewRoman,4,792.0,612.0,48,114,0.42105263157894735,0.08421052966201437,0.956140350877193,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.09028789250537603,0.0,3003,1,1.8000001907348633,233,1,2.4682814149115675,False,False,True,2,4,2.5,0.5,4.0,H1,0.4444444444444444,471.0005187988281,592.8836517333984,0.7944231847543379,32,15.3125,490,5.451020408163266,0.4959183673469388,3233,0.7757500773275595,0.01639344262295082,0.01824930405196412,0.17383235385091247,0.31385642737896496,0.774247491638796,False,True,False,38,0,0.0,17,0.8596491228070176,H1,Paragraph,7AUNHNHEJ5WZYXSDOPHTM3UHLGVPSSX6.pdf

If a critical assumption has not been met, the APA may be revised by agreement of the parties.   If such agreement cannot be achieved, the APA may be canceled.

"of comparable transactions or business activities of independent companies has been finalized.   The comparability of the finalized set has then been enhanced through the application of  adjustments.        Sources of Comparables    Comparables used in APAs can be U.S. or foreign.  This depends on the relevant market, the  type of transaction being evaluated, and the results of the functional and risk analyses.  In  general, comparables have been located by searching a variety of databases that provide data on  U.S. publicly traded companies and on a combination of public and private non-U.S. companies.   Table 19 shows the various databases and other sources used in selecting comparables for the  APAs executed in Year 2002.      Although comparables were most often identified from the databases cited in Table 19, in some  cases comparables were found from other sources, such as comparables derived internally from  taxpayer transactions with third parties.    Selecting Comparables    Initial pools of potential comparables generally are derived from the databases using a  combination of industry and keyword identifiers. Then, the pool is refined using a variety of  selection criteria specific to the transaction or business activity being tested and the TPM being  used.    The listed databases allow for searches by industrial classification, by keywords, or by both.   These searches can yield a number of companies whose business activities may or may not be  comparable to those of the entity being tested.  Therefore, comparables based solely on industry  classification or keyword searches are rarely used in APAs.  Instead, the pool of comparables is  examined closely, and companies are selected based on a combination of screens, business  descriptions, and other information found in the companies’ Annual Reports to shareholders and  filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      Business activities are required to meet certain basic comparability criteria to be considered  comparables.  Functions, risks, economic conditions, and the property (product or intangible) and  services associated with the transaction must be comparable.  Determining comparability can be  difficult – the goal has been to use comparability criteria restrictive enough to eliminate business  activities that are not comparable, but yet not so restrictive as to have no comparables remaining.   The APA Program normally has begun with relatively strict comparability criteria and then has  relaxed them slightly if necessary to derive a pool of reliable comparables.  A determination on  the appropriate size of the comparables set, as well as the business activities that comprise the  set, is highly fact specific and depends on the reliability of the results.    In addition, the APA Program, consistent with the section 482 regulations, generally has looked  at the results of comparables over a multi-year period.  Sometimes this has been three years, but  it has been more or less, depending on the circumstances of the controlled transaction.  Using a  shorter period might result in the inclusion of comparables in different stages of economic",20,"(71.99993896484375, 71.50801086425781, 542.8868408203125, 705.7918090820312)",12.0,TimesNewRoman,4,792.0,612.0,58,114,0.5087719298245614,0.08421052966201437,0.956140350877193,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.09028789250537603,1.8000001907348633,205,1,0.0,2684,1,2.418837196329063,False,False,True,2,2,1.5,0.5,2.0,Title,0.3333333333333333,470.88690185546875,634.2837982177734,0.7423915023189598,21,22.333333333333332,469,5.631130063965885,0.5138592750533049,3183,0.8074143889412504,0.0034558592522777255,0.01633678919258561,0.17027961043041157,0.40038684719535783,0.8624031007751938,False,False,False,4,0,0.0,50,0.5701754385964912,H2,Paragraph,7AUNHNHEJ5WZYXSDOPHTM3UHLGVPSSX6.pdf
"development or use of atypical years of a comparable subject to cyclical fluctuations in business  conditions.      Many covered transactions have been tested with comparables that have been chosen using  additional criteria and/or screens. These include sales level criteria and tests for financial distress  and product comparability.  These common selection criteria and screens have been used to  increase the overall comparability of a group of companies and as a basis for further research.   The sales level screen, for example, has been used to remove companies that, due to their size,  might face fundamentally different economic conditions from those of the transaction or business  activities being tested.  In addition, APA analyses have incorporated selection criteria related to  removing companies experiencing ""financial distress"" due to concerns that companies in  financial distress often have experienced unusual circumstances that would render them not  comparable to the business activity being tested.  These criteria include:  an unfavorable auditor's  opinion, bankruptcy, and in certain circumstances, operating losses in a given number of years.    An additional important class of selection criteria is the development and ownership of  intangible property.  In some cases in which the business activity being tested is a manufacturer,  several criteria have been used to ensure, for example, that if the controlled entity does not own  significant manufacturing intangibles or conduct research and development (R&D), then neither  will the comparables.  These selection criteria have included determining the importance of  patents to a company or screening for R&D expenditures as a percentage of sales.  Again,  quantitative screens related to identifying comparables with significant intangible property  generally have been used in conjunction with an understanding of the comparable derived from  publicly available business information.    Selection criteria relating to asset comparability and operating expense comparability have also  been used at times.  A screen of property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) as a percentage of sales  or assets, combined with a reading of a company's SEC filings, has been used to help ensure that  distributors (generally lower PP&E) were not compared with manufacturers (generally higher  PP&E), regardless of their industry classification.  Similarly, a test involving the ratio of  operating expenses to sales has helped to determine whether a company undertakes a significant  marketing and distribution function.

Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(d)(2).  In almost all cases involving  income-statement-based PLIs, certain ""asset intensity"" or ""balance sheet"" adjustments for factors  that have generally agreed-upon effects on profits are calculated.  In addition, in specific cases,  additional adjustments are performed to improve reliability.    The most common balance sheet adjustments used in APAs are adjustments for differences in  accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable.  The APA Program generally has  required adjustments for receivables, inventory, and payables based on the principle that there is  an opportunity cost for holding assets.  For these assets it is generally assumed that the cost is a  short-term debt interest rate.     To compare the profits of two business activities with different relative levels of receivables,  inventory, or payables, the APA Program estimates the carrying costs of each item and adjusts  profits accordingly.  Although different formulas have been used in specific APA cases,  Attachment B presents one set of formulas used in many APAs.  Underlying these formulas are  the notions that (1) balance sheet items should be expressed as mid-year averages, (2) formulas  should try to avoid using data items that are being tested by the TPM (for example, if sales are  controlled, then the denominator of the balance sheet ratio should not be sales), (3) a short-term  interest rate should be used, and (4) an interest factor should recognize the average holding  period of the relevant asset.",22,"(68.4000015258789, 72.3041763305664, 538.6919555664062, 710.5918579101562)",12.0,TimesNewRoman,4,792.0,612.0,60,114,0.5263157894736842,0.08421052966201437,0.956140350877193,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.09129315193253335,0.0,2684,1,0.0,1986,1,1.5634522148517336,False,False,True,2,2,1.5,0.5,2.0,Title,0.3333333333333333,470.29195404052734,638.2876815795898,0.7368024914356511,12,28.083333333333332,337,5.605341246290801,0.6201780415430267,2318,0.7679033649698016,0.012942191544434857,0.013805004314063849,0.18507333908541845,0.2960199004975124,0.9152119700748129,False,True,True,14,7,0.0,51,0.5614035087719298,H2,Paragraph,7AUNHNHEJ5WZYXSDOPHTM3UHLGVPSSX6.pdf
"The APA Program also requires that data be compared on a consistent accounting basis.  For  example, although financial statements may be prepared on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis,  cross-company comparisons are less meaningful if one or more of the comparables use LIFO  inventory accounting methods.  This adjustment directly affects costs of goods sold and  inventories, and therefore affects both profitability measures and inventory adjustments.    Still important in some cases is the adjustment for differences in relative levels of PP&E between  a tested business activity and the comparables.  Ideally, comparables and the business activity  being tested will have fairly similar relative levels of PP&E, since major differences can be a  sign of fundamentally different functions and risks.  Typically, the PP&E adjustment is made  using a medium term interest rate.    Additional adjustments used less frequently include those for differences in other balance sheet  items, operating expenses, R&D, or currency risk.  Accounting adjustments, such as  reclassifying items from cost of goods sold to operating expenses, for example, are also made  when warranted to increase reliability.  Often, data is not available for both the controlled and  uncontrolled transactions in sufficient detail to allow for these types of adjustments.

"Discussion    Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(1) states that sometimes a pricing method will yield ""a single result that  is the most reliable measure of an arm's length result.""  Sometimes, however, a method may yield  ""a range of reliable results,"" called the ""arm's length range.""  A taxpayer whose results fall within  the arm's length range will not be subject to adjustment.    Under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(2)(i), such a range is normally derived by considering a set of  more than one comparable uncontrolled transaction of similar comparability and reliability.  If  these comparables are of very high quality, as defined in the Regulations, then under Treas. Reg.  § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(A), the arm's length range includes the results of all of the comparables (from  the least to the greatest).  However, the APA Program has only rarely identified cases meeting  the requirements for the full range.  If the comparables are of lesser quality, then under Treas.  Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(B), ""the reliability of the analysis must be increased, when it is possible  to do so, by adjusting the range through application of a valid statistical method to the results of  all of the uncontrolled comparables.""  One such method, the ""interquartile range,"" is ordinarily  acceptable, although a different statistical method ""may be applied if it provides a more reliable  measure."" The ""interquartile range"" is defined as, roughly, the range from the 25th to the 75th  percentile of the comparables' results. See Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(2)(iii)(C).  The interquartile  range was used 39 times in Year 2002.    Nineteen covered transactions reflected on Table 23 specified a single, specific result, or ""point.""   Ten of these covered transactions involved a CPM in which the taxpayer agreed to a specific  result.  Some APAs specify not a point or a range, instead using a ""floor"" that requires the tested  party's result be greater than or equal to some particular value.  Four APAs executed in Year  2002 used a floor.      Some APAs look to a tested party’s results over a period of years (multi-year averaging) to  determine whether a taxpayer has complied with the APA.  In 2002, rolling multi-year averaging  was used for twelve covered transactions.  Eleven of those used three-year averages, and the  other one used a five-year average.  Cumulative multi-year averages were used for two covered  transactions.  Of those two transactions, one used a five-year average, and one used a seven-year  average.  Additionally, nine covered transactions used term averages.    Adjustments    Under Treas. Reg. § 1.482-1(e)(3), if a taxpayer's results fall outside the arm's length range, the  Service may adjust the result ""to any point within the arm's length range.""  Accordingly, an APA  may permit or require a taxpayer and its related parties to make an adjustment after the year's end  to put the year's results within the range, or at the point specified by the APA.  Similarly, to  enforce the terms of an APA, the Service may make such an adjustment.  When the APA  specifies a range, the adjustment is sometimes to the closest edge of the range, and sometimes to  another point such as the median of the interquartile range.  Depending on the facts of each case,  such automatic adjustments are not always permitted.  APAs may specify that in such a case  there will be a negotiation between the competent authorities involved to determine whether and  to what extent an adjustment should be made.  APAs may permit automatic adjustments unless",24,"(71.99996948242188, 71.50801086425781, 542.9998779296875, 705.7919921875)",12.0,TimesNewRoman,4,792.0,612.0,63,114,0.5526315789473685,0.08421052966201437,0.956140350877193,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.09028789250537603,0.0,293,1,0.0,1145,1,2.7817577607246466,False,False,True,4,7,4.0,0.5,7.0,H1,0.45161290322580644,470.9999084472656,634.2839813232422,0.7425694520373451,40,13.925,557,5.242369838420108,0.4883303411131059,3550,0.7583098591549295,0.015774647887323943,0.022253521126760562,0.17746478873239438,0.32503457814661135,0.7188365650969529,False,False,False,42,31,0.0,7,0.9473684210526315,H1,Paragraph,7AUNHNHEJ5WZYXSDOPHTM3UHLGVPSSX6.pdf
"the result is far outside the range specified in the APA.  Thus APAs provide flexibility and  efficiency, permitting adjustments when normal business fluctuations and uncertainties push the  result somewhat outside the range.    In order to conform the taxpayer's books to these tax adjustments, the APA usually permits a  ""compensating adjustment"" as long as certain requirements are met.  Such compensating  adjustments may be paid between the related parties with no interest, and the amount transferred  will not be considered for purposes of penalties for failure to pay estimated tax.

"Approaches for Sharing of Currency or Other Risks  [§ 521(b)(2)(D)(xii)]    During Year 2002, there were 38 tested parties that faced financial risks, including interest rate  and currency risks.  Eleven APAs provide specific approaches for dealing with currency risk,  including adjustment mechanisms and critical assumptions.      Efforts to Ensure Compliance with APAs  [§ 521(b)(2)(F)]    As described in Rev. Proc. 96-53, section 11, APA taxpayers are required to file annual reports  to demonstrate compliance with the terms and conditions of the APA.  The filing and review of  annual reports is a critical part of the APA process.  Through annual report review, the APA  program monitors taxpayer compliance with the APA on a contemporaneous basis.  Annual  report review provides current information on the success or problems associated with the  various TPMs adopted in the APA process.    All reports received by the APA Office are tracked by one designated APA team leader who also  has the primary responsibility for annual report review.  One of the economists also spends a  significant amount of time reviewing annual reports.  Other APA team leaders also assist in this  review, especially when the team leader who negotiated the case is available, since that person  will already be familiar with the relevant facts and terms of the agreement.  Once received by the  APA Office, the annual report is sent out to the district personnel with exam jurisdiction over the  taxpayer.      The statistics for the review of APA annual reports are reflected in Table 28 below.  As of  December 31, 2002, there were 101 pending annual reports.  In Year 2002, there were 330  reports closed.

"GENERAL INFORMATION    The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires the Massachusetts Division of Banks (the  “Division”) to use its authority when examining financial institutions subject to its supervision, to  assess the institution's record of meeting the needs of its entire assessment area, including low and  moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operation of the institution.  Upon  conclusion of such examination, the Division must prepare a written evaluation of the institution's  record of meeting the credit needs of its community.     This document is an evaluation of the CRA performance of BARRE SAVINGS BANK, prepared by  the Division, the institution's supervisory agency, as of JUNE 23, 2004.  The Division evaluates  performance in the assessment area(s), as they are defined by the institution, rather than individual  branches.  This assessment area evaluation may include the visits to some, but not necessarily all  of the institution’s branches.  The Division rates the CRA performance of an institution consistent  with the provisions set forth in 209 CMR 46.00.    INSTITUTION'S CRA RATING: This institution is rated ""Satisfactory""    The Bank’s overall CRA rating is based upon its performance under the five criteria contained  herein.  The following is a summarization of the findings, presented in descending order of weight  given to each criteria, that were utilized in formulating the bank’s overall CRA rating:     Distribution of Credit among Different Income Levels    There was a substantial distribution of HMDA-reportable lending to individuals of low- and  moderate-income, given the demographics of the Bank’s assessment area.     Comparison of Credit Extended Inside And Outside of the Assessment Area(s)    A majority of the Bank’s HMDA-reportable lending was originated inside its assessment area.    Loan to Deposit Analysis    The Bank was determined to have a reasonable level of net loan to deposit ratios over the eight  quarter period reviewed.     Geographic Distribution of Loans    The Bank made a strong penetration of HMDA-reportable lending to the middle-income census  tracts in its assessment area.

"3.   DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT AMONG DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS    Based upon the subsequent analysis, the Bank’s distribution of its HMDA-reportable lending within  its assessment area to borrowers of different incomes is considered to be substantial.  Therefore,  the Bank was determined to exceed the standards for satisfactory performance in this criterion.    An analysis of HMDA-reportable lending extended within the Bank’s assessment area, among  various income levels for the period under review, was performed.  Originations were categorized  by the ratio of the applicants’ reported incomes to the 2002 and 2003 estimated median family  incomes of the appropriate MSA (refer to the Performance Context Section).     Low-income is defined by the US Census Bureau as income below 50 percent of the median family  income level for the MSA; moderate-income is defined as 50 to 79 percent of the median family  income; middle-income is defined as income between 80 and 119 percent of the median family  income; and upper-income is defined as income greater than 120 percent of the median family  income.    The following analysis also includes 2002 aggregate data (exclusive of Barre Savings Bank) of  HMDA-reportable lending by percentage, as well as demographic data on the percentage of  households (per 1990 and 2000 census data) in the assessment area in each respective  income group.

"DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT AMONG DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS (continued)    As indicated in the table, the Bank’s percentage of lending to low- and moderate-income borrowers  is significantly above that of the aggregate in 2002.  For calendar year 2003, the percentage of  lending in the low-income category has increased, while the percentage of lending in the moderate- income category declined somewhat.      By dollar volume in 2002, the Bank originated 1.3 percent of its HMDA-reportable lending to low- income borrowers, exceeding the 2002 aggregate data by dollar volume of 0.9 percent to low- income borrowers.  Lending by dollar volume to moderate-income borrowers was 14.0 percent,  while aggregate lending was 7.5 percent to those borrowers in 2002.    For calendar year 2003, the Bank’s HMDA-reportable lending by dollar volume was 2.5 percent to  low-income borrowers and 13.0 percent to moderate-income borrowers.  Also of particular note is  the marked increase in the dollar volume of loans granted in these two income categories.

"4.  GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LOANS    The following analysis indicates that the Bank appears to have achieved a reasonable penetration  of its HMDA-reportable lending to the census tracts within its assessment area.  Therefore, the  Bank was determined to meet the standards for satisfactory performance at this time.    Based upon both 1990 and 2000 census data, the Bank’s assessment area contained eleven  census tracts.  Of those tracts, four (36.4 percent) are middle-income, and seven (63.6 percent)  are upper-income.  There are no low- or moderate-income census tracts within the Bank’s  assessment area.    Further, an analysis of the Bank’s HMDA-reportable lending extended within the various census  tracts contained within its assessment area for calendar year 2003 was also conducted.  It should  be noted that, as of January 1, 2003, a revision to Regulation C (HMDA reporting) went into effect.  This revision states in part…”For all applications and loans reported on lenders’ 2003 HMDA/LARs,  lenders must use the census tract numbers and corresponding geographic areas from the 2000  census.”    An analysis of HMDA-reportable lending extended within the various census tracts contained within  the Bank’s assessment area was also conducted.  The following table presents the Bank’s  performance, as well as the 2002 aggregate data (exclusive of Barre Savings Bank) of HMDA- reportable lending by percentage.  In addition, the table also reflects the percentage of owner- occupied housing units (per 1990 and 2000 census data) in each of the census tract income  categories.",10,"(72.0, 29.423147201538086, 543.0646362304688, 345.0885009765625)",10.979999542236328,ArialMT,0,792.0,612.0,86,120,0.7166666666666667,0.7849992712338771,1.0,True,False,0.9599990844726562,False,False,0.03715043838578041,0.0,1196,1,-0.9599990844726562,74,0,2.5966633772839125,False,False,True,6,5,1.5,0.5,6.0,Title,0.46153846153846156,471.06463623046875,315.6653537750244,1.492291221057468,11,21.454545454545453,236,5.622881355932203,0.6059322033898306,1594,0.7710163111668757,0.027603513174404015,0.015683814303638646,0.16750313676286072,0.30604982206405695,0.7928571428571428,True,True,False,10,0,0.0,8,0.9416666666666667,Title,Paragraph,7GB7EXTYK2SHE3R3CBCOYKLOQT4CMEAF.pdf

In conclusion, although lacking low- and moderate-income census tracts within its assessment  area, the Bank’s penetration of its middle-income census tracts within its assessment area is  considered to be very strong.",10,"(59.40000915527344, 452.0919189453125, 549.2418823242188, 686.7920532226562)",10.020000457763672,ArialMT,0,792.0,612.0,101,120,0.8416666666666667,-0.1749998132387791,0.8,False,True,0.0,False,False,0.5708231299814551,0.0,4,0,0.9599990844726562,3623,1,1.5980932835683908,False,False,True,2,1,0.5,0.0,2.0,Title,0.5714285714285714,489.8418731689453,234.70013427734375,2.087096689046211,6,27.833333333333332,167,5.11377245508982,0.5688622754491018,1070,0.6495327102803738,0.10560747663551402,0.03177570093457944,0.20186915887850468,0.31891891891891894,0.7717391304347826,False,True,True,0,0,0.0,37,0.7,H3,Paragraph,7GB7EXTYK2SHE3R3CBCOYKLOQT4CMEAF.pdf
"5.  REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS/FAIR LENDING POLICIES AND PRACTICES    The Bank received no CRA related complaints in the period under review.  The Bank has a  satisfactory record of implementing fair lending policies and practices.  The following discussion  is based on the guidelines of the Division’s Regulatory Bulletin 2-3-101.  The institution’s loan  policy prohibits discrimination against all the prohibited classes listed under the Equal Credit  Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act.  In the area of fair lending, the Bank’s compliance  policy addresses second review and employee training.       As a portfolio mortgage lender, the Bank offers 1-year (1/1), 3-year (3/3), 5-year (5/5), and 5/1  Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) products.  In addition, the Bank offers 15-, 20-, and 30-year  fixed rate mortgage loans.  The maximum loan to value (LTV) for mortgage products is 95  percent, with private mortgage insurance required for LTV’s over 80 percent.  All mortgage loan  applications are underwritten to FNMA standards.     The Bank’s first time homebuyer product consists of a discounted 5/1 ARM with a 95 percent  loan to value (LTV), and expanded qualifying ratios.  In the twelve months prior to this  evaluation, the Bank originated 3 first time homebuyer 5/1 ARMs for a total of $403,000.  In  addition, the Bank promoted its mortgage products in November 2002, and again in March and  April of 2003, by offering a reduced closing cost option via a special $500 off coupon.  The  coupons appeared in the Bank’s newspaper advertisements and on the Bank’s website.    The Bank offers both Home Equity Loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC).  Home  Equity Loans have a fixed interest rate, a maximum term of 15 years and an 80 percent LTV.   HELOCs have a variable rate (tied to the Prime Rate), a 10-year draw period (with a 15-year  repayment term) and maximum LTV of 80 percent.  Currently on HELOCs, the Bank offers two  discounted interest rate options; the first is a 2.99% (for the first six months) and the second a  0% interest rate (for the first 2 months).     The Bank continues to offer consumer loan products offerings including new and used  automobile loans, unsecured personal loans, overdraft protection lines of credit, passbook  loans, and other types of secured personal loans.  Applications for Home Equity Loans and  HELOCs, car loans, and overdraft protection are offered via the Bank’s website,  www.barrebank.com.     The Bank utilizes two local weekly publications, The Landmark, published in Holden, and The  Barre Gazette, published in Barre, to advertise both its banking services and credit products.   Both these publications are circulated in the towns within the Bank’s assessment area.  In  addition, the Bank periodically advertises its loan products in the Worcester Telegram and  Gazette, which is circulated throughout all of Worcester County.  In March of 2004, the Bank  participated as an exhibitor in the Worcester County Home Show, held at the Worcester  Centrum.     It is the Bank’s policy to provide all staff members with ongoing training opportunities in order to  keep staff informed of changes in banking regulations and to enhance job knowledge and skills.  The Bank’s lending staff recently attended seminars on the changes to the Home Mortgage  Disclosure Act and teleconference (and internet based) training on FNMA’s Desktop  Underwriter program.    There is a second review committee comprised of three members of senior management.  The  committee reviews all denied loan applications, including mortgage, equity, and consumer loan  requests.",11,"(71.99947357177734, 29.423147201538086, 546.0878295898438, 684.212158203125)",10.979999542236328,ArialMT,0,792.0,612.0,102,120,0.85,0.7849992712338771,1.0,True,False,0.9599990844726562,False,False,0.03715043838578041,0.9599990844726562,1070,1,0.0,584,1,6.463263988254894,False,False,True,10,8,3.0,0.5,10.0,Title,0.46511627906976744,474.0883560180664,654.7890110015869,0.7240322425278414,27,20.555555555555557,555,5.376576576576577,0.5387387387387388,3623,0.7695280154568037,0.019321004692243997,0.019044990339497653,0.17637317140491304,0.3,0.7772795216741405,True,True,False,24,0,0.0,2,0.9916666666666667,Title,Paragraph,7GB7EXTYK2SHE3R3CBCOYKLOQT4CMEAF.pdf

"GENERAL INFORMATION    The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires the Massachusetts Division of Banks (the  “Division”) to use its authority when examining financial institutions subject to its supervision, to  assess the institution's record of meeting the needs of its entire assessment area, including low and  moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operation of the institution.  Upon  conclusion of such examination, the Division must prepare a written evaluation of the institution's  record of meeting the credit needs of its community.     This document is an evaluation of the CRA performance of BARRE SAVINGS BANK, prepared by  the Division, the institution's supervisory agency, as of JUNE 23, 2004.  The Division evaluates  performance in the assessment area(s), as they are defined by the institution, rather than individual  branches.  This assessment area evaluation may include the visits to some, but not necessarily all  of the institution’s branches.  The Division rates the CRA performance of an institution consistent  with the provisions set forth in 209 CMR 46.00.    INSTITUTION'S CRA RATING: This institution is rated ""Satisfactory""    The Bank’s overall CRA rating is based upon its performance under the five criteria contained  herein.  The following is a summarization of the findings, presented in descending order of weight  given to each criteria, that were utilized in formulating the bank’s overall CRA rating:     Distribution of Credit among Different Income Levels    There was a substantial distribution of HMDA-reportable lending to individuals of low- and  moderate-income, given the demographics of the Bank’s assessment area.     Comparison of Credit Extended Inside And Outside of the Assessment Area(s)    A majority of the Bank’s HMDA-reportable lending was originated inside its assessment area.    Loan to Deposit Analysis    The Bank was determined to have a reasonable level of net loan to deposit ratios over the eight  quarter period reviewed.     Geographic Distribution of Loans    The Bank made a strong penetration of HMDA-reportable lending to the middle-income census  tracts in its assessment area.  There are no low- or moderate-income census tracts within the  Bank’s assessment area.    Review of Complaints/Fair Lending Policies and Practices    The Bank’s fair lending policies and practices are considered reasonable.  No weight was given to a  review of complaints, as none have been received since the prior examination.",2,"(71.99983215332031, 42.32353973388672, 543.0979614257812, 664.8320922851562)",10.979999542236328,ArialMT,0,792.0,612.0,8,120,0.06666666666666667,0.7849992712338771,1.0,True,False,0.9599990844726562,False,False,0.05343881279531151,0.0,313,1,0.0,471,1,4.349878045639409,False,False,True,12,6,3.5,0.5,12.0,Title,0.5454545454545454,471.09812927246094,622.5085525512695,0.756773746066182,14,25.785714285714285,361,5.772853185595568,0.5734072022160664,2514,0.7971360381861575,0.005171042163882259,0.012728719172633254,0.17104216388225935,0.3584905660377358,0.7825059101654847,False,True,True,8,6,0.0,1,1.0,Title,Paragraph,7GB7EXTYK2SHE3R3CBCOYKLOQT4CMEAF copy.pdf

"Total Loans  100.0         Source: FDIC Call Report, 03/31/04    As indicated, overall residential real estate lending represents the majority of the Bank’s portfolio, at  87.4 percent.  The second largest segment of the loan portfolio is overall commercial lending at 5.0  percent.     The Bank operates three branch office locations: its main office located on Common Street in Barre,  a branch office in Paxton, and an office in Princeton.

"PERFORMANCE CRITERIA    1.  LOAN TO DEPOSIT ANALYSIS    Based upon the following, the Bank’s net loan to deposit ratio appears to be reasonable and, as  such, was determined to meet the standards for satisfactory performance.     An analysis of the Bank’s net loan to deposit ratios was performed.  The calculation incorporated  eight quarters of the Bank’s net loan to deposit figures, as reflected in its quarterly FDIC Call  Reports.

"3.   DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT AMONG DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS    Based upon the subsequent analysis, the Bank’s distribution of its HMDA-reportable lending within  its assessment area to borrowers of different incomes is considered to be substantial.  Therefore,  the Bank was determined to exceed the standards for satisfactory performance in this criterion.    An analysis of HMDA-reportable lending extended within the Bank’s assessment area, among  various income levels for the period under review, was performed.  Originations were categorized  by the ratio of the applicants’ reported incomes to the 2002 and 2003 estimated median family  incomes of the appropriate MSA (refer to the Performance Context Section).     Low-income is defined by the US Census Bureau as income below 50 percent of the median family  income level for the MSA; moderate-income is defined as 50 to 79 percent of the median family  income; middle-income is defined as income between 80 and 119 percent of the median family  income; and upper-income is defined as income greater than 120 percent of the median family  income.    The following analysis also includes 2002 aggregate data (exclusive of Barre Savings Bank) of  HMDA-reportable lending by percentage, as well as demographic data on the percentage of  households (per 1990 and 2000 census data) in the assessment area in each respective  income group.

"DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT AMONG DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS (continued)    As indicated in the table, the Bank’s percentage of lending to low- and moderate-income borrowers  is significantly above that of the aggregate in 2002.  For calendar year 2003, the percentage of  lending in the low-income category has increased, while the percentage of lending in the moderate- income category declined somewhat.      By dollar volume in 2002, the Bank originated 1.3 percent of its HMDA-reportable lending to low- income borrowers, exceeding the 2002 aggregate data by dollar volume of 0.9 percent to low- income borrowers.  Lending by dollar volume to moderate-income borrowers was 14.0 percent,  while aggregate lending was 7.5 percent to those borrowers in 2002.    For calendar year 2003, the Bank’s HMDA-reportable lending by dollar volume was 2.5 percent to  low-income borrowers and 13.0 percent to moderate-income borrowers.  Also of particular note is  the marked increase in the dollar volume of loans granted in these two income categories.

"4.  GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF LOANS    The following analysis indicates that the Bank appears to have achieved a reasonable penetration  of its HMDA-reportable lending to the census tracts within its assessment area.  Therefore, the  Bank was determined to meet the standards for satisfactory performance at this time.    Based upon both 1990 and 2000 census data, the Bank’s assessment area contained eleven  census tracts.  Of those tracts, four (36.4 percent) are middle-income, and seven (63.6 percent)  are upper-income.  There are no low- or moderate-income census tracts within the Bank’s  assessment area.    Further, an analysis of the Bank’s HMDA-reportable lending extended within the various census  tracts contained within its assessment area for calendar year 2003 was also conducted.  It should  be noted that, as of January 1, 2003, a revision to Regulation C (HMDA reporting) went into effect.  This revision states in part…”For all applications and loans reported on lenders’ 2003 HMDA/LARs,  lenders must use the census tract numbers and corresponding geographic areas from the 2000  census.”    An analysis of HMDA-reportable lending extended within the various census tracts contained within  the Bank’s assessment area was also conducted.  The following table presents the Bank’s  performance, as well as the 2002 aggregate data (exclusive of Barre Savings Bank) of HMDA- reportable lending by percentage.  In addition, the table also reflects the percentage of owner- occupied housing units (per 1990 and 2000 census data) in each of the census tract income  categories.",10,"(72.0, 29.423147201538086, 543.0646362304688, 345.0885009765625)",10.979999542236328,ArialMT,0,792.0,612.0,86,120,0.7166666666666667,0.7849992712338771,1.0,True,False,0.9599990844726562,False,False,0.03715043838578041,0.0,1196,1,-0.9599990844726562,74,0,2.5966633772839125,False,False,True,6,5,1.5,0.5,6.0,Title,0.46153846153846156,471.06463623046875,315.6653537750244,1.492291221057468,11,21.454545454545453,236,5.622881355932203,0.6059322033898306,1594,0.7710163111668757,0.027603513174404015,0.015683814303638646,0.16750313676286072,0.30604982206405695,0.7928571428571428,True,True,False,10,0,0.0,8,0.9416666666666667,Title,Paragraph,7GB7EXTYK2SHE3R3CBCOYKLOQT4CMEAF copy.pdf

"5.  REVIEW OF COMPLAINTS/FAIR LENDING POLICIES AND PRACTICES    The Bank received no CRA related complaints in the period under review.  The Bank has a  satisfactory record of implementing fair lending policies and practices.  The following discussion  is based on the guidelines of the Division’s Regulatory Bulletin 2-3-101.  The institution’s loan  policy prohibits discrimination against all the prohibited classes listed under the Equal Credit  Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act.  In the area of fair lending, the Bank’s compliance  policy addresses second review and employee training.       As a portfolio mortgage lender, the Bank offers 1-year (1/1), 3-year (3/3), 5-year (5/5), and 5/1  Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) products.  In addition, the Bank offers 15-, 20-, and 30-year  fixed rate mortgage loans.  The maximum loan to value (LTV) for mortgage products is 95  percent, with private mortgage insurance required for LTV’s over 80 percent.  All mortgage loan  applications are underwritten to FNMA standards.     The Bank’s first time homebuyer product consists of a discounted 5/1 ARM with a 95 percent  loan to value (LTV), and expanded qualifying ratios.  In the twelve months prior to this  evaluation, the Bank originated 3 first time homebuyer 5/1 ARMs for a total of $403,000.  In  addition, the Bank promoted its mortgage products in November 2002, and again in March and  April of 2003, by offering a reduced closing cost option via a special $500 off coupon.  The  coupons appeared in the Bank’s newspaper advertisements and on the Bank’s website.    The Bank offers both Home Equity Loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC).  Home  Equity Loans have a fixed interest rate, a maximum term of 15 years and an 80 percent LTV.   HELOCs have a variable rate (tied to the Prime Rate), a 10-year draw period (with a 15-year  repayment term) and maximum LTV of 80 percent.  Currently on HELOCs, the Bank offers two  discounted interest rate options; the first is a 2.99% (for the first six months) and the second a  0% interest rate (for the first 2 months).     The Bank continues to offer consumer loan products offerings including new and used  automobile loans, unsecured personal loans, overdraft protection lines of credit, passbook  loans, and other types of secured personal loans.  Applications for Home Equity Loans and  HELOCs, car loans, and overdraft protection are offered via the Bank’s website,  www.barrebank.com.     The Bank utilizes two local weekly publications, The Landmark, published in Holden, and The  Barre Gazette, published in Barre, to advertise both its banking services and credit products.   Both these publications are circulated in the towns within the Bank’s assessment area.  In  addition, the Bank periodically advertises its loan products in the Worcester Telegram and  Gazette, which is circulated throughout all of Worcester County.  In March of 2004, the Bank  participated as an exhibitor in the Worcester County Home Show, held at the Worcester  Centrum.     It is the Bank’s policy to provide all staff members with ongoing training opportunities in order to  keep staff informed of changes in banking regulations and to enhance job knowledge and skills.  The Bank’s lending staff recently attended seminars on the changes to the Home Mortgage  Disclosure Act and teleconference (and internet based) training on FNMA’s Desktop  Underwriter program.    There is a second review committee comprised of three members of senior management.  The  committee reviews all denied loan applications, including mortgage, equity, and consumer loan  requests.",11,"(71.99947357177734, 29.423147201538086, 546.0878295898438, 684.212158203125)",10.979999542236328,ArialMT,0,792.0,612.0,102,120,0.85,0.7849992712338771,1.0,True,False,0.9599990844726562,False,False,0.03715043838578041,0.9599990844726562,1070,1,0.0,584,1,6.463263988254894,False,False,True,10,8,3.0,0.5,10.0,Title,0.46511627906976744,474.0883560180664,654.7890110015869,0.7240322425278414,27,20.555555555555557,555,5.376576576576577,0.5387387387387388,3623,0.7695280154568037,0.019321004692243997,0.019044990339497653,0.17637317140491304,0.3,0.7772795216741405,True,True,False,24,0,0.0,2,0.9916666666666667,Title,Paragraph,7GB7EXTYK2SHE3R3CBCOYKLOQT4CMEAF copy.pdf

"Adjudication of water rights through the state courts should be completed to fully define  and quantify all state, tribal and federal water rights.       Discussion:  The purpose of a general stream adjudication is to provide certainty and predictability in the  administration and distribution of water diverting from hydraulically connected water sources.  The  need for a general adjudication of water rights in the Snake River Basin became apparent as the  spring flows in the Thousand Springs reach began to decline and disputes arose over the availability  of water supplies on the Snake River Plain.  As part of the 1984 Swan Falls Agreement, the State  agreed to commence the Snake River Basin Adjudication, the largest legal proceeding in the history  of the state.  The SRBA is the cornerstone for the long-term management of the Snake River Basin  within Idaho. At the conclusion of the SRBA, the state will have a listing of all water rights within the  basin, which is the predicate for establishing water districts to administer all water rights in  accordance with the prior appropriation doctrine, as established by law.    Pursuant to Idaho Code § 42-1734(3), the IWRB is authorized to represent the state, when requested  to do so by the Governor, in proceedings, negotiations, and hearings involving the federal  government. In the SRBA, the IWRB coordinated state participation in the negotiation of federal  reserved water rights, including tribal claims. The IWRB successfully negotiated agreements  resolving federal reserved right claims including those filed by the Shoshone-Bannock, Nez Perce,  and Shoshone-Paiute tribes as well as the claims of numerous federal agencies.  The final settlement  of the Nez Perce Tribe’s claims reflected the tribe’s and the state’s shared interest in addressing  environmental concerns and addressed the conflicting demands for consumptive and nonconsumptive  uses.  Consistent with state law, Tthe IWRB should serve as the lead agency for coordinating state  participation in all general stream adjudications.      On November 12, 2008, the district court ordered the commencement of an adjudication in the Coeur  d’Alene Spokane River water system.  Like the SRBA, the determination of all existing water rights  from the water basins in Northern Idaho will provide the basis for administration of water rights in  accordance with the prior appropriation doctrine, as established by law.",1,"(67.67996215820312, 86.32801818847656, 560.7593994140625, 641.9639892578125)",12.0,TimesNewRomanPSMT,4,792.0,612.0,1,2,0.5,0.0,1.0,True,True,0.0,True,True,0.10900002296524819,0.0,30,0,0.0,0,0,1.0,False,True,False,5,6,1.5,0.0,6.0,H1,0.48,493.0794372558594,555.6359710693359,0.8874145356480703,13,28.384615384615383,369,5.5257452574525745,0.5149051490514905,2450,0.8069387755102041,0.0069387755102040816,0.013877551020408163,0.16775510204081634,0.3647342995169082,0.801452784503632,False,True,True,2,0,0.0,2,0.5,H1,Paragraph,53MPVZWCXMT55PDT4CQCJ2MN5JAKIAGV.pdf
